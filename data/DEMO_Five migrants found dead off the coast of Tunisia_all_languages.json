                            "text": "On Monday, Tunisia's coastguard retrieved the bodies of five migrants, raising the week's death toll to 11. They also rescued a total of 663 migrants, reflecting a surge in crossings from North Africa to Italy due to improved weather.\n\nThe coastguard reported on Monday that five bodies were recovered near the coastal city of Sfax. In the past four days, a total of 11 migrants have been found dead in the area.\n\nTunisian security forces have also prevented 3,058 migrants from crossing to Europe by boat since Friday. The majority of them are said to have come from sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nOn Monday alone, 633 people were stopped from setting off by boat from Tunisia towards Europe following a rescue mission. Security forces also reportedly arrested 120 smugglers.\n\nAdditionally, a shipwreck off the Italian coast over the weekend likely resulted in the death of a 15-month-old girl.\n\nAlso read: 17 Tunisian migrants missing at sea as reported deaths reach record high\n\nOil tanker rescues refugees\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, an oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea picked up 139 people from an unseaworthy vessel on their way to Europe from Libya, Italian authorities reported.\n\nDuring the rescue operation, three migrants fell into the water and remain missing at sea. The initial search for them was unsuccessful, according to reports.\n\nThe rest of the rescued migrants were taken by the Italian coastguard to the Italian Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. The migrants were said to have originated from various African countries, as well as from Syria, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nLampedusa, situated between Sicily and Tunisia, has long been a focal point of the smuggling trade. Reports indicate that passengers paid between $3,000 and $7,000 for the dangerous journey on the 12-meter boat.\n\nAlso read: EU-Tunisia migration deal: Encouraging the people smugglers?\n\nNew agreements on migration and labor\n\nUnder a recent agreement signed between the Italian and Albanian governments, rescued migrants from the Mediterranean could soon increasingly be taken to Albania for processing -- instead of remaining at a reception center in Lampedusa before being transferred to the Italian mainland. Two reception centers and a repatriation center are scheduled to open in Albania in May to facilitate this process.\n\nThis comes after the EU reached a controversial agreement with Tunisia late last year: in exchange for millions of euros in financial aid, the North African country is expected to take stronger action against traffickers and illegal crossings. However, there have been doubts about the sustainability of this agreement.\n\nEarlier this year, Italy and Tunisia also signed a deal to bring 12,000 Tunisian workers to Italy over the next three years. Under the deal, Italian and Tunisian labor organizations, Sviluppo Lavoro Italia and Aneti, will collaborate to identify the workforce requirements of the Italian market and the Tunisian workers who could meet those demands.\n\nAlso read: EU criticized over migration deal with Egypt\n\nFewer crossings compared to last year\n\nAccording to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES), over 1,300 migrants attempting to cross to Europe from the coast of Tunisia were killed in 2023.\n\nCompared to last year, the number of migrants arriving in Italy via the central Mediterranean route, mostly from Tunisia and Libya, has meanwhile decreased.\n\nThe Italian Interior Ministry counted nearly 9500 people reaching Italy by sea so far this year, compared to over 20,000 in the same period last year.\n\nAlso read: Italy: Two migrants saved by Ocean Viking detained in Ancona\n\nWith dpa and Reuters"

                            "text": "More than 63,000 people died or disappeared on migration routes over the past decade, with more than a third fleeing conflict.\n\nMore than 63,000 people died or disappeared on migration routes around the world over the last decade, with drowning the biggest cause of death, according to the United Nations migration agency.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) published the alarming death toll on Tuesday in a report on its Missing Migrants Project, which has been investigating the disappearances of people fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty since 2014.\n\nSince tracking began, at least 63,285 people have died or are missing and presumed dead, according to the project, with over 8,500 losing their lives in 2023, the deadliest year yet. Nearly 60 percent of deaths documented were linked to drowning, with the number of victims surpassing 36,000.\n\nOf those deaths at sea, more than 27,000 occurred in the Mediterranean, a route followed over the years by many migrants trying to reach southern Europe from northern Africa.\n\nMost deaths in the Central Mediterranean were documented off the coast of Libya. But the IOM had recorded an \u201cincrease in departures and, correspondingly, shipwrecks\u201d off the coast of Tunisia. At least 729 people died off the Tunisian coast in 2023, compared to 462 the previous year.\n\n\u201cThe figures are quite alarming,\u201d Jorge Galindo, a spokesperson at IOM\u2019s Global Data Institute, told The Associated Press news agency. \u201cWe see that 10 years on, people continue to lose their lives in search of a better one.\u201d\n\n\u2018Invisible shipwrecks\u2019\n\nThe IOM stressed the figures published in the report were incomplete, \u201clikely only a fraction of the actual number of lives lost worldwide\u201d because of the difficulty in obtaining and verifying information.\n\nOn the Atlantic route from Africa\u2019s west coast to Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, entire boats have reportedly vanished in what are known as \u201cinvisible shipwrecks\u201d. Similarly, many deaths in the Sahara Desert are believed to go unreported.\n\nEven when deaths are recorded, more than two-thirds of the victims remain unidentified. In more than half of all cases, the IOM was unable to even establish the sex or age of the migrant.\n\nIn cases that could be identified, just over one-third came from \u201ccountries in conflict or with large refugee populations\u201d.\n\nDespite the limits in the data, the IOM had recorded the deaths of \u201calmost 5,500 females\u201d on migration routes and \u201cnearly 3,500\u201d children.\n\nThe IOM said there was an \u201curgent need for strengthened search and rescue capacities\u201d, as well as \u201csafe, regular migration pathways\u201d to prevent further deaths.\n\nAt sea, greater assistance was needed for migrants in distress \u201cin line with international law and the principle of humanity\u201d, the IOM said.\n\nCurrently on the Mediterranean Sea, \u201cthe large majority of search and rescue is done by nongovernmental organisations\u201d, Galindo said.\n\nAnti-immigration sentiment\n\nWhen the IOM\u2019s project began in 2014, European sentiment was more sympathetic to the plight of migrants, and the Italian government had launched \u201cMare Nostrum,\u201d a major search-and-rescue mission that saved thousands of lives.\n\nBut, with anti-immigration political parties steadily gaining influence across Europe, governments have attempted to curb migration flows to their countries by pledging funds to countries across the Mediterranean such as Tunisia and Egypt.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union pledged a 7.4-billion euro ($8bn) funding package to Egypt that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described as \u201cthe best way to address migratory flows\u201d.\n\nTauhid Pasha, acting Chief of Mission for IOM Libya, told Al Jazeera that the narrative around immigration needs to change.\n\nHe said that countries that are gripped by anti-immigration sentiment need to acknowledge the positives around migration better.\n\nMigration contributes to the development of the migrant\u2019s origin and the countries as well as the countries they are heading to, he said.\n\n\u201cMany countries have shown that there are distinct labour shortages, demographic deficits, and migrants can help fulfil some of those shortages\u201d, Pasha said."

                            "text": "GENEVA \u2014 The U.N. migration agency reported Tuesday that at least 63,285 people have died or gone missing on migration routes worldwide between 2014 and 2023, with the majority of deaths due to drowning.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration (IOM) published a report indicating that the Mediterranean saw the highest number of deaths and disappearances, totaling 28,854, followed by Africa and Asia.\n\nDrowning was linked to nearly 60% of documented deaths, and over a third of those identified came from conflict-ridden countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, and Ethiopia.\n\n2023 was the deadliest year for migrants in the past decade, with 8,541 deaths recorded, partly because of an increase in fatalities in the Mediterranean. \u201cThe increase in deaths is likely linked to the increase in departures and, correspondingly, shipwrecks, off the coast of Tunisia,\u201d the report stated. It noted that at least 729 people died off the Tunisian coast in 2023, up from 462 in 2022, marking a shift from previous years where most Central Mediterranean deaths were off Libya\u2019s coast.\n\nAs anti-immigration parties gain influence in Europe, governments have sought to reduce migration flows by offering financial support to North African nations like Tunisia and Egypt. This month, the European Union announced a \u20ac7.4 billion ($8 billion) funding package for Egypt, which Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni described as \u201cthe best way to address migratory flows.\u201d\n\nCountries including Italy, Hungary, and Britain have prioritized immigration reduction, while far-right parties, such as France\u2019s National Rally led by Marine Le Pen, have risen in popularity.\n\nReligious leaders, including Pope Francis, have advocated for greater compassion towards migrants, with the Pope calling for a pan-European migration response to prevent the Mediterranean from becoming \u201ca sea of death.\u201d"

                            "text": "More than a decade ago, the death of 600 migrants and refugees in two Mediterranean shipwrecks near Italian shores shocked the world and prompted the UN migration agency to start recording the number of people who died or went missing as they fled conflict, persecution or poverty to other countries.\n\nGovernments around the world have repeatedly pledged to save migrants' lives and fight smugglers while tightening borders.\n\nYet 10 years on, a report by the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project published Tuesday shows the world is no safer for people on the move.\n\nOn the contrary, migrant deaths have soared.\n\nSince tracking began in 2014, more than 63,000 have died or are missing and presumed dead, according to the Missing Migrants Project, with 2023 being the deadliest year yet.\n\n\u201cThe figures are quite alarming,\u201d Jorge Galindo, a spokesperson at IOM's Global Data Institute, told The Associated Press. \"We see that 10 years on, people continue to lose their lives in search of a better one.\u201d\n\nThe report says the deaths are \"likely only a fraction of the actual number of lives lost worldwide\u201d because of the difficulty in obtaining and verifying information.\n\nFor example, on the Atlantic route from Africa's west coast to Spain's Canary Islands, entire boats have reportedly vanished in what are known as \u201cinvisible shipwrecks.\u201d Similarly, countless deaths in the Sahara desert are believed to go unreported.\n\nEven when deaths are recorded, more than two-thirds of the victims remain unidentified. That can be due to a lack of information and resources, or simply because identifying dead migrants is not considered a priority.\n\nExperts have called the growing number of unidentified migrants around the world a crisis comparable to mass casualties seen in wartime.\n\nBehind each nameless death is a family facing \u201cthe psychological, social, economic and legal impacts of unresolved disappearances,\u201d a painful phenomenon known as \u201cambiguous loss,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u201cGovernments need to work together with civil society to make sure that the families that are left behind, not knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones, can have better access to the remains of people who have died,\u201d Galindo said.\n\nOf the victims whose nationalities were known to IOM, one in three died while fleeing countries in conflict.\n\nNearly 60% of the deaths recorded by the IOM in the last decade were related to drowning. The Mediterranean Sea is the world's largest migrant grave with more than 28,000 deaths recorded in the last decade.\n\nThousands of drownings have also been recorded on the U.S.-Mexico border, in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Gulf of Aden, and increasingly in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea where desperate Rohingya refugees are embarking on overcrowded boats.\n\n\u201cSearch and rescue capacities to assist migrants at sea must be strengthened, in line with international law and the principle of humanity,\u201d the report says.\n\nCurrently in the Mediterranean \"the large majority of search and rescue is done by nongovernmental organizations,\u201d Galindo said.\n\nWhen the Missing Migrants Project began in 2014, European sentiment was more sympathetic to the plight of migrants, and the Italian government had launched \u201cMare Nostrum,\u201d a major search-and-rescue mission that saved thousands of lives.\n\nBut the solidarity didn't last, and European search and rescue missions were progressively cut back after fears that they would encourage smugglers to launch even more people on cheaper and deadlier boats. That's when NGOs stepped in.\n\nTheir help has not always been welcomed. Italy and Greece, have faced increasing bureaucratic and legal obstacles.\n\nFollowing the 2015-2016 migration crisis, the European Union began outsourcing border control and sea rescues to North African countries to \u201csave lives\u201d while also keeping migrants from reaching European shores.\n\nThe controversial partnerships have been criticized by human rights advocates, particularly the one with Libya. EU-trained and funded Libyan coast guards have been linked to human traffickers exploiting migrants who are intercepted and brought back to squalid detention centers.\n\nA U.N.-backed group of experts has found that the abuses committed against migrants on the Mediterranean and in Libya may amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nDespite the rise of border walls and heightened surveillance worldwide, smugglers always seem to find lucrative alternatives, leading migrants and refugees on longer and more perilous routes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an absence of safe migration options,\u201d Galindo said. \"And this needs to change.\u201d\n\nSearch Keywords:\n\nShort link:\n\n"

That can be due to lack of information and resources, or simply because identifying dead migrants is not considered a priority.\n\nExperts have called the growing number of unidentified migrants around the world a crisis comparable to mass casualties seen in wartime.\n\nBehind each nameless death is a family facing \u201cthe psychological, social, economic and legal impacts of unresolved disappearances,\u201d a painful phenomenon known as \u201cambiguous loss,\u201d the report says.\n\nREAD MORE: Texas blocked border agents attempting to save 3 migrants who drowned, U.S. officials say\n\n\u201cGovernments need to work together with civil society to make sure that the families that are left behind, not knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones, can have better access to the remains of people who have died,\u201d Galindo said.\n\nOf the victims whose nationalities were known to IOM, one in three died while fleeing countries in conflict.\n\nNearly 60% of the deaths recorded by the IOM in the last decade were related to drowning. The Mediterranean Sea is the world\u2019s largest migrant grave with more than 28,000 deaths recorded in the last decade. Thousands of drownings have also been recorded on the U.S.-Mexico border, in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Gulf of Aden and increasingly in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea where desperate Rohingya refugees are embarking on overcrowded boats.\n\n\u201cSearch and rescue capacities to assist migrants at sea must be strengthened, in line with international law and the principle of humanity,\u201d the report says.\n\nCurrently on the Mediterranean \u201cthe large majority of search and rescue is done by nongovernmental organizations,\u201d Galindo said.\n\nWhen the Missing Migrants Project began in 2014, European sentiment was more sympathetic to the plight of migrants, and the Italian government had launched \u201cMare Nostrum,\u201d a major search-and-rescue mission that saved thousands of lives.\n\nBut the solidarity didn\u2019t last, and European search and rescue missions were progressively cut back after fears that they would encourage smugglers to launch even more people on cheaper and deadlier boats. That\u2019s when NGOs stepped in.\n\nTheir help has not always been welcomed. In Italy and Greece, they have faced increasing bureaucratic and legal obstacles.\n\nREAD MORE: Boat with dozens of Rohingya Muslim refugees on board capsizes off Indonesia\u2019s coast\n\nFollowing the 2015-2016 migration crisis, the European Union began outsourcing border control and sea rescues to North African countries to \u201csave lives\u201d while also keeping migrants from reaching European shores.\n\nThe controversial partnerships have been criticized by human rights advocates, particularly the one with Libya. EU-trained and funded Libyan coast guards have been linked to human traffickers exploiting migrants who are intercepted and brought back to squalid detention centers. A U.N.-backed group of experts has found that the abuses committed against migrants on the Mediterranean and in Libya may amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nDespite the rise of border walls and heightened surveillance worldwide, smugglers always seem to find lucrative alternatives, leading migrants and refugees on longer and more perilous routes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an absence of safe migration options,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cAnd this needs to change.\u201d\n\nBrito reported from Barcelona, Spain."

(Photo by MOHAMMED ABED / AFP)\n\nAn Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city killed at least nine people, six of them children, hospital authorities said Saturday, as Israel pursued its nearly seven-month offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael's war against the armed group Hamas has led to a dramatic escalation of tensions in an already volatile Middle East.\n\nThe strike late Friday hit a residential building in the western Tel Sultan neighborhood of the city of Rafah, according to Gaza\u2019s civil defense. The bodies of the six children, two women and a man were taken to Rafah's Abu Yousef al-Najjar hospital, the hospital\u2019s records showed.\n\nAt the hospital, relatives cried and hugged the bodies of the children, wrapped in white shrouds, as others comforted them.\n\nThe fatalities included Abdel-Fattah Sobhi Radwan, his wife Najlaa Ahmed Aweidah and their three children, his brother-in-law Ahmed Barhoum said. Barhoum also lost his wife, Rawan Radwan, and their 5-year-old daughter Alaa.\n\n\"This is a world devoid of all human values and morals,\u201d Barhoum told The Associated Press Saturday morning, crying as he cradled and gently rocked the body of Alaa in his arms. \u201cThey bombed a house full of displaced people, women and children. There were no martyrs but women and children.\u201d\n\nNo victims were registered from a second overnight strike in the city.\n\nRafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, currently hosts more than half of Gaza\u2019s total population of about 2.3 million people, the vast majority of whom have been displaced by fighting further north in the territory.\n\nDespite calls for restraint from the international community, including Israel\u2019s staunchest ally, the United States, the Israeli government has insisted for months that it intends to push a ground offensive into the city, where it says many of the remaining Hamas fighters are holed up.\n\nSuch a ground operation has not materialized so far, but the Israeli military has repeatedly carried out airstrikes on and around the city.\n\nThe war was sparked by an unprecedented raid into southern Israel by Hamas and other armed groups on Oct. 7 that left about 1,200 people dead, the vast majority of them civilians, and saw about 250 people kidnapped and taken into Gaza. Israel says about 130 hostages remain in Gaza, although more than 30 have been confirmed to now be dead, either killed on Oct. 7 or having died in captivity.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday the bodies of 37 people killed by Israeli strikes were brought to hospitals in Gaza over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 68 wounded, it said. The latest figures bring the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,049, and the number of wounded to 76,901, the ministry said. Although the Hamas-run health authorities do not differentiate between combatants and civilians in their count, they say at least two thirds have been children and women.\n\nThe war has sent regional tensions spiraling, leading to a dramatic eruption of violence between Israel and its archenemy Iran that threatened to escalate into a full-blown war.\n\nOn Friday, both Iran and Israel played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran, indicating the two sides were pulling back from what could have become an all-out conflict. Over the past several weeks, an alleged Israeli strike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian consulate in Syria and was followed by an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel.\n\nIsrael has also faced off with the Hezbollah party, an Iranian proxy operating from Lebanon, with the two sides there frequently trading rocket and drone attacks across the Lebanese-Israeli border. Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi militias have also joined the fray, launching strikes against merchant ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in what they say is a campaign of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nTension has also been high in the occupied West Bank, where an Israeli military raid Friday in the Nur Shams refugee camp killed at least four Palestinians, including three militants, according to the Israeli military, Palestinian health officials and a militant group.\n\nPalestinian health authorities said one of those killed was a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Israeli fire. The Islamic Jihad group confirmed the deaths of three members, including one who it said was a local military commander. The Israeli military said four Israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the operation.\n\nSaraya al-Quds, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said its fighters had engaged in heavy gun battles Saturday morning with Israeli forces in the town of Tulkarem, adjacent to Nur Shams. No further details were immediately available. Residents in Tulkarem went on a general strike Saturday to protest the attack on Nur Shams, with shops, restaurants and government offices all closed.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, more than 460 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank, Palestinian health officials say. Israel stages frequent raids into towns and cities in the volatile territory. The dead have included militants, but also stone-throwers and bystanders. Some have also been killed in attacks by Israeli settlers."

                            "text": "On Monday, Tunisia's coastguard retrieved the bodies of five migrants, raising the week's death toll to 11. They also rescued a total of 663 migrants, reflecting a surge in crossings from North Africa to Italy due to improved weather.\n\nThe coastguard reported on Monday that five bodies were recovered near the coastal city of Sfax. In the past four days, a total of 11 migrants have been found dead in the area.\n\nTunisian security forces have also prevented 3,058 migrants from crossing to Europe by boat since Friday. The majority of them are said to have come from sub-Sahara Africa.\n\nOn Monday alone, 633 people were stopped from setting off by boat from Tunisia towards Europe following a rescue mission. Security forces also reportedly arrested 120 smugglers.\n\nAdditionally, a shipwreck off the Italian coast over the weekend likely resulted in the death of a 15-month-old girl.\n\nAlso read: 17 Tunisian migrants missing at sea as reported deaths reach record high\n\nOil tanker rescues refugees\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, an oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea picked up 139 people from an unseaworthy vessel on their way to Europe from Libya, Italian authorities reported.\n\nDuring the rescue operation, three migrants fell into the water and remain missing at sea. The initial search for them was unsuccessful, according to reports.\n\nThe rest of the rescued migrants were taken by the Italian coastguard to the Italian Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. The migrants were said to have originated from various African countries, as well as from Syria, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\n\nLampedusa, situated between Sicily and Tunisia, has long been a focal point of the smuggling trade. Reports indicate that passengers paid between $3,000 and $7,000 for the dangerous journey on the 12-meter boat.\n\nAlso read: EU-Tunisia migration deal: Encouraging the people smugglers?\n\nNew agreements on migration and labor\n\nUnder a recent agreement signed between the Italian and Albanian governments, rescued migrants from the Mediterranean could soon increasingly be taken to Albania for processing -- instead of remaining at a reception center in Lampedusa before being transferred to the Italian mainland. Two reception centers and a repatriation center are scheduled to open in Albania in May to facilitate this process.\n\nThis comes after the EU reached a controversial agreement with Tunisia late last year: in exchange for millions of euros in financial aid, the North African country is expected to take stronger action against traffickers and illegal crossings. However, there have been doubts about the sustainability of this agreement.\n\nEarlier this year, Italy and Tunisia also signed a deal to bring 12,000 Tunisian workers to Italy over the next three years. Under the deal, Italian and Tunisian labor organizations, Sviluppo Lavoro Italia and Aneti, will collaborate to identify the workforce requirements of the Italian market and the Tunisian workers who could meet those demands.\n\nAlso read: EU criticized over migration deal with Egypt\n\nFewer crossings compared to last year\n\nAccording to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES), over 1,300 migrants attempting to cross to Europe from the coast of Tunisia were killed in 2023.\n\nCompared to last year, the number of migrants arriving in Italy via the central Mediterranean route, mostly from Tunisia and Libya, has meanwhile decreased.\n\nThe Italian Interior Ministry counted nearly 9500 people reaching Italy by sea so far this year, compared to over 20,000 in the same period last year.\n\nAlso read: Italy: Two migrants saved by Ocean Viking detained in Ancona\n\nWith dpa and Reuters"
