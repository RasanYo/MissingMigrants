The remaining passengers were missing and feared drowned.\n\nThe Spanish coastguard said the helicopters, a rescue boat and two other ships headed 104km (65 miles) south of Gran Canaria after a rescue plane had spotted a dinghy barely afloat at sea.\n\nOne of the helicopters rescued 11 people and took them to Gran Canaria, where two of them were being treated for hypothermia in health centres, while another two were taken to Tenerife.\n\nSpain\u2019s Canary Islands, located around 97km (60 miles) off the coast of Morocco, have become a hot spot for migrants trying to reach Europe in recent years.\n\nLast year some 4,400 people were lost at sea attempting to reach Spain, according to a monitoring group. A total of 22,316 migrants and refugees crossed by boat to the Canary Islands in 2021, after 23,271 made the crossing in 2020.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated 3,077 migrants and refugees died or went missing while trying to reach Europe by sea in 2021. This includes 1,153 people who died on the ocean route from northwest Africa to the Canary Islands.\n\noperated by the humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) rescued roughly 200 people on Monday from two boats in distress in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe organisation tweeted that all were safe on board, and that the Geo Barents will continue to search for boats in distress.\n\nWe rescued roughly 200 people from two boats in distress this morning. Everyone is now safe on board our ship while we continue the search for more boats in distress. Right after the rescue we saw the Libyan Coast Guard navigating at a very close distance from the #GeoBarents. pic.twitter.com/p9I2kFVSwU \u2014 MSF Sea (@MSF_Sea) May 9, 2022\n\nOver 300 migrants and refugees have been rescued in the Mediterranean following operations by aid organisations and freighter vessels in the last four days.\n\nIn a challenging two-day rescue mission starting Friday evening, two container ships sailing under the German flag as well as the Sea-Eye 4 rescue vessel were able to take 34 people travelling in a small wooden boat on board.\n\nAccording to Sea-Eye, the Hamburg container ship Berlin Express had discovered the wooden boat and issued a distress call. Due to bad weather conditions and the nature of the ship, the freighter was unable to take the migrants on board.\n\n\u201cWithout the crews of the Berlin Express and the BSG Bahamas the people would have had no chance to survive. They would have died of thirst or drowned,\u201d said Gorden Isler from Sea-Eye."

            "text": "The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) demands \u201curgent action\u201d over deaths at sea \u2013 according to a report released by the agency on 29 April more than 3,000 people died or went missing attempting to reach Europe by Sea in 2021. Meanwhile, the latest period is marked by a series of deadly tragedies on the central Mediterranean and Atlantic routes.\n\nSpeaking of a new report released by UNHCR on deaths at sea in 2021, spokesperson Shabia Mantoo stated: \u201cOf the 2021 total, 1,924 people were reported dead or missing on the Central and Western Mediterranean routes, while an additional 1,153 perished or went missing on the Northwest African maritime route to the Canary Islands\u201d. UNHCR appeals for: \u201cmeaningful alternatives to these dangerous journeys\u201d, and the prevention of people becoming victims of traffickers\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the death-count on the Central Mediterranean route for 2022 is already at 550 according the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The civil rescue operator SOS MEDITERRANEE has published the testimony of a survivor rescued by its vessel Ocean Viking from a boat in distress in Libyan waters on 25 April. 12 lives were lost according to the rescue operator. After carrying out four rescue operations since 24 April the Ocean Viking had 295 survivors on-board including a one-year old baby. Despite numerous requests for a port of safety to disembark the Ocean Viking remained stuck at sea with survivors facing increasing psychological distress. \u201cAfter up to ten days at sea amid rough weather conditions, the 294 remaining women, children and men rescued in the central Mediterranean by Ocean Viking in four difficult operations are exhausted. Keeping survivors rescued from near-death at sea stranded on a rescue ship is disgraceful,\u201d SOS MEDITERRANEE stated on 4 May. The day after on 5 May the organisation finally confirmed that it had been assigned a port in Pozzalo. On 1 May M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF Sea) announced that its vessel Geo Barents had been assigned a port of safety in Augusta Sicily for 101 survivors including four children and a pregnant woman rescued in international waters off Libya on 23 April. The permission to disembark came only after days of waiting. On 4 May Sea-Watch announced that: \u201c57 people have just been rescued by our crew. Onboard our United4Rescue alliance ship Sea-Watch 4, they now receive something to eat and drink, new clothes if needed, and medical care\u201d.\n\nAccording to IOM more than 4,400 people have been intercepted and returned to Libya by the EU funded so-called Libyan Coast Guard, recently threatening civilian rescuers in international waters, in 2022 as of 23 April. Evidence of widespread and extreme human rights abuse in war-torn Libya, including crimes against humanity has been mounting for years and a recent testimony by a survivor is cooperated by MSF: \u201cWe see a lot of them with actual physical evidence of violence, injuries that cause long-term problems,\u201d MSF doctor Mohammed Fadlalla told AFP, continuing: \u201cWe commonly see bullet wounds, burns, evidence of electrocution, lots of beatings\u201d. EU cooperation with Libya has been critisised as complicity in human rights abuse and the civilian search and rescue operator, Sea-Watch recently launched a lawsuit against the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) at the EU General Court in Luxembourg over the agency\u2019s refusal to release documents detailing its working relations with the so-called Libyan Coast Guard. Former director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri has resigned, reportedly as the result of increased scrutiny of the agency\u2019s misconduct and implication in human rights violations.\n\nAccording to UNHCR the Atlantic route to the Canary Islands cost 1,153 lives in 2021 \u2013 traffic on the deadly route has continued to increase in 2022. On 26 \u2013 27 April at least 31 people lost their lives while attempting to reach the Canary Islands. Just 36 of 61 people remained afloat when Spanish rescuers from Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo arrived to a boat in distress 245 kilometers off the Canary Islands on 26 April \u2013 one body was recovered and 24 believed to have died. Another six people from a boat in distress on the route carrying a total of 59 people were reported dead on 27 April. Further, Salvamento Mar\u00edtimo, that recently denounced the Spanish governments \u201cmilitarization of maritime rescues\u201d, has been involved in several rescues in the Strait of Gibraltar rescuing 39 people on 2 May and on the same day another person seeking to cross the strait on a fragile boat.

            "text": "Three migrants have been confirmed dead and ten others declared missing after their makeshift boat sank off the coast of east-central Tunisia, the National Guard said on Friday.\n\nAccording to the same source, 44 other migrants were rescued.\n\nThe boat, which left from the coast of Sfax with more than 50 migrants on board, all of Tunisian nationality, sank off the coast of this port city, said Houcem Eddine Jebabli, spokesman for the National Guard, the Tunisian gendarmerie.\n\nThe migrants were trying to reach Europe illegally.\n\nThe city of Sfax is one of the main departure points for Tunisian and foreign migrants, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, to the Italian coast.\n\nThe rate of illegal departures is likely to increase as the summer approaches.\n\nAt the beginning of May, the Tunisian authorities announced that they had found the bodies of 24 drowned migrants after their boats sank off the coast of Sfax.\n\nBetween 22 and 30 April, four boats capsized off the coast of Sfax, causing the drowning of migrants to recover in the following days, while 97 people were rescued.\n\nItaly is one of the main points of entry into Europe for migrants from North Africa, who arrive mainly from Tunisia and Libya, two countries from which departures increased considerably in 2021.\n\nThat year, 15,671 migrants, including 584 women, managed to reach Italian soil from the Tunisian coast, compared to 12,883 (including 353 women) in 2020, according to the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights (FTDES).\n\nIn total, more than 123,000 migrants landed in Italy in 2021, compared to some 95,000 the previous year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n\nNearly 2,000 migrants went missing or drowned in the Mediterranean in the same year, compared to 1,401 in 2020, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM)."
