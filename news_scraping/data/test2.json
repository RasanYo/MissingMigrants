The remaining passengers were missing and feared drowned.\n\nThe Spanish coastguard said the helicopters, a rescue boat and two other ships headed 104km (65 miles) south of Gran Canaria after a rescue plane had spotted a dinghy barely afloat at sea.\n\nOne of the helicopters rescued 11 people and took them to Gran Canaria, where two of them were being treated for hypothermia in health centres, while another two were taken to Tenerife.\n\nSpain\u2019s Canary Islands, located around 97km (60 miles) off the coast of Morocco, have become a hot spot for migrants trying to reach Europe in recent years.\n\nLast year some 4,400 people were lost at sea attempting to reach Spain, according to a monitoring group. A total of 22,316 migrants and refugees crossed by boat to the Canary Islands in 2021, after 23,271 made the crossing in 2020.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated 3,077 migrants and refugees died or went missing while trying to reach Europe by sea in 2021. This includes 1,153 people who died on the ocean route from northwest Africa to the Canary Islands.\n\noperated by the humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) rescued roughly 200 people on Monday from two boats in distress in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe organisation tweeted that all were safe on board, and that the Geo Barents will continue to search for boats in distress.\n\nWe rescued roughly 200 people from two boats in distress this morning. Everyone is now safe on board our ship while we continue the search for more boats in distress. Right after the rescue we saw the Libyan Coast Guard navigating at a very close distance from the #GeoBarents. pic.twitter.com/p9I2kFVSwU \u2014 MSF Sea (@MSF_Sea) May 9, 2022\n\nOver 300 migrants and refugees have been rescued in the Mediterranean following operations by aid organisations and freighter vessels in the last four days.\n\nIn a challenging two-day rescue mission starting Friday evening, two container ships sailing under the German flag as well as the Sea-Eye 4 rescue vessel were able to take 34 people travelling in a small wooden boat on board.\n\nAccording to Sea-Eye, the Hamburg container ship Berlin Express had discovered the wooden boat and issued a distress call. Due to bad weather conditions and the nature of the ship, the freighter was unable to take the migrants on board.\n\n\u201cWithout the crews of the Berlin Express and the BSG Bahamas the people would have had no chance to survive. They would have died of thirst or drowned,\u201d said Gorden Isler from Sea-Eye."

            "text": "UNHCR reports that over 3,000 people either died or went missing while trying to reach Europe via sea in 2021. The UN agency has asked for urgent measures to ward off an increase in people losing their lives on these journeys.\n\nMore than 3,000 people died or went missing in the central and western Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean while trying to reach Europe last year, the United Nations said in a report released on Friday, April 29.\n\nThe UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has called for urgent support to prevent deaths and protect refugees and asylum seekers that undertake dangerous journeys via land and sea.\n\nIt added in a statement that 1,924 people had been reported as dead or missing on the routes of the central and western Mediterranean, while another 1,153 had been on the sea route from northwestern Africa towards the Canary Islands.\n\nA total of 1,544 had instead been reported dead in 2020 on the two routes. At least 478 people have been reported dead or missing at sea so far this year.\n\nRisks for travel via land and sea\n\n\"Most of the sea crossings took place in packed, unseaworthy, inflatable boats, many of which capsized or were deflated leading to the loss of life,\" UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo told reporters in Geneva.\n\n\"The sea journey from West African coastal states such as Senegal and Mauritania to the Canary Islands is long and perilous and can take up to 10 days,\" Mantoo added.\n\n\"Many boats have gone off course or disappeared without a trace in these waters,\" she said.\n\nUNHCR says land routes can also be very dangerous for migrants and estimates that even more people may have died crossing the Sahara Desert or when held in captivity and abused by traffickers or smugglers.\n\nExtrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, sexual and gender-based violence, and forced labour and marriage are just some of the abuses reported by people traveling these routes, the report stated.\n\nCOVID-related border closures impacted movements towards North Africa and European coastal countries, with many desperate refugees and migrants turning to smugglers, it added.\n\nCall for alternatives to dangerous journeys\n\nUNHCR asked for \"support in providing meaningful alternatives to these dangerous journeys and prevent people from becoming victims of traffickers. The approach calls for increased humanitarian assistance, support and solutions for people in need of international protection and survivors of gross human rights abuses.\n\n\"It covers some 25 countries across four regions connected by the same land and sea routes used by migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, and includes countries of origin, departure, first asylum, transit and destination.\"\n\n\"States must ensure unimpeded humanitarian access for the delivery of essential services to people on the move or stranded en route, intercepted at sea, or held in detention centres, and to determine whether they have international protection needs,\" the UNHCR spokesperson said.\n\nIf these important measures are not carried out, refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people and others will continue to move onwards in dangerous journeys in search of safety and protection.Other people, including migrants, will move in search of a better life, hoping to find work or educational opportunities elsewhere in the absence of sufficient seasonal or longer-term legal pathways for safe and orderly migration, she said."

However, according to Helena Maleno, the founder of the NGO Caminando Fronteras, 44 migrants died after their boat sank off Cape Boujdour, Western Sahara.\n\n\"Seven bodies were transferred to the morgue and the other victims were swallowed by the sea,\" she added on Twitter. Twelve other migrants survived the sinking and were arrested, according to the same source.\n\nHelena Malenon did not specify the destination of the boat, but migrant boats departing from this area usually head for the Spanish archipelago of the Canaries. Located at the north-western tip of Africa, Morocco is a transit country for many migrants seeking to reach Europe from its Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts.\n\nAccording to figures from the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, more than 14,700 attempted illegal departures were prevented and 52 smuggling networks dismantled in Morocco during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn 2021, 4,404 migrants died or disappeared during their sea crossing to Spain, the worst toll since 2015, according to Caminando Fronteras, which keeps track of these migration tragedies thanks to calls from migrants or their relatives on its emergency numbers.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Spanish Interior Ministry, more than 40,000 migrants, mostly from Morocco, arrived in the country by sea in 2021, as well as in the Balearic and Canary Islands."
