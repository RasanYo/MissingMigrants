The remaining passengers were missing and feared drowned.\n\nThe Spanish coastguard said the helicopters, a rescue boat and two other ships headed 104km (65 miles) south of Gran Canaria after a rescue plane had spotted a dinghy barely afloat at sea.\n\nOne of the helicopters rescued 11 people and took them to Gran Canaria, where two of them were being treated for hypothermia in health centres, while another two were taken to Tenerife.\n\nSpain\u2019s Canary Islands, located around 97km (60 miles) off the coast of Morocco, have become a hot spot for migrants trying to reach Europe in recent years.\n\nLast year some 4,400 people were lost at sea attempting to reach Spain, according to a monitoring group. A total of 22,316 migrants and refugees crossed by boat to the Canary Islands in 2021, after 23,271 made the crossing in 2020.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated 3,077 migrants and refugees died or went missing while trying to reach Europe by sea in 2021. This includes 1,153 people who died on the ocean route from northwest Africa to the Canary Islands.\n\noperated by the humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) rescued roughly 200 people on Monday from two boats in distress in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe organisation tweeted that all were safe on board, and that the Geo Barents will continue to search for boats in distress.\n\nWe rescued roughly 200 people from two boats in distress this morning. Everyone is now safe on board our ship while we continue the search for more boats in distress. Right after the rescue we saw the Libyan Coast Guard navigating at a very close distance from the #GeoBarents. pic.twitter.com/p9I2kFVSwU \u2014 MSF Sea (@MSF_Sea) May 9, 2022\n\nOver 300 migrants and refugees have been rescued in the Mediterranean following operations by aid organisations and freighter vessels in the last four days.\n\nIn a challenging two-day rescue mission starting Friday evening, two container ships sailing under the German flag as well as the Sea-Eye 4 rescue vessel were able to take 34 people travelling in a small wooden boat on board.\n\nAccording to Sea-Eye, the Hamburg container ship Berlin Express had discovered the wooden boat and issued a distress call. Due to bad weather conditions and the nature of the ship, the freighter was unable to take the migrants on board.\n\n\u201cWithout the crews of the Berlin Express and the BSG Bahamas the people would have had no chance to survive. They would have died of thirst or drowned,\u201d said Gorden Isler from Sea-Eye."

Survivors said the bodies of the dead were thrown overboard.\n\nSpanish police say they believe 25 people died when their boat got into trouble during an eight-day journey from Mauritania to the Canary Islands.\n\nThe boat, which set sail from Nouakchott in Mauritania, was rescued off the small island of El Hierro on Sunday, March 27 with 48 people on board. Canarias7, a local Spanish language newspaper, reported that a child who was among the arrivals had died. Five other people, two of them minors, were taken to hospital.\n\nAbout 75 people had been on board when the boat left the Mauritanian coast on March 19, news reports say.\n\nIn a statement, the police said the boat had experienced \"terrible conditions\" during the long journey at sea.\n\n\"Within days, their water supplies ran out and they only had biscuits to eat,\" the statement continued. Some people resorted to drinking sea water to quench their thirst.\n\nAlso read: Spain's Canary Islands draw more migrants despite dangers\n\nSkippers arrested on suspicion of murder\n\nPolice said that \"according to survivors' testimonies, 25 people had likely died and their bodies were thrown overboard.\" One man had also been beaten during the journey, according to Canarias7.\n\nThree people thought to be the boat's skippers were arrested on suspicion of murder, the police statement said. Two remain in preventative custody.\n\nCanarias7 also reports that on March 27, a boat carrying 12 people, all in good health, arrived at the port of Los Cristianos in Tenerife.

They were later beaten to death by a Muslim mob, which sparked riots that killed about 65 people, mostly Muslims, and displaced thousands.\n\nViolence has not returned to the district known as the country's sugarcane-belt, but political divisions remain as Hindus typically vote for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Muslims for the opposition.\n\nModi's government has \"controlled Muslims\", said Ramesh Chand, a Hindu biscuit baker in Kairana city near Muzaffarnagar.\n\nCritics accuse the nationalist BJP of targeting India's 200 million minority Muslims to please their hardline Hindu base - charges they deny.\n\nModi is widely expected to win a third term on the back of strong growth, welfare and his personal popularity despite some concern about unemployment, price rises and rural distress.\n\nChand said Modi had improved security in the region. \"We can live in peace, whether or not we have jobs ... We can sleep with our doors open.\"\n\nThere were opposing views too.\n\nIn Jaula village, sugarcane farmer Mohammed Irfan, 50, said Modi's \"high-handedness against Muslims\" as well as unemployment and inflation were major reasons for him voting for the opposition Samajwadi Party.\n\nUttar Pradesh elects 80 lawmakers to the 543-member lower house of parliament, the most among all states, and a strong showing here is critical to the nationwide outcome.\n\nSupport for Modi was visible in Kutba Kutbi village, the epicentre of the 2013 riots.\n\nAlthough there is \"brotherhood\" between the two communities now, nearly all Muslim families left the village after the riots, said Vinay Kumar Baliyan, 43, a farmer who said he supports Modi for promoting economic growth and raising India's stature globally.\n\nBut Irfan said Muslims are expected to vote in larger numbers this time as Eid celebrations this month brought many migrant workers and students home."

More than 3,000 people died or went missing in the Mediterranean or Atlantic last year on attempts to reach Europe.\n\nIn comparison, 1,439 people died or went missing on those routes in 2019, and about 1,800 in 2020.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, the U.N. refugee agency reports an additional 553 people also have died or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe.\n\nUNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said desperation is driving more people to make perilous sea journeys in search of protection and a better life.\n\n\n\n\"Most of the sea crossings took place in packed, unseaworthy, inflatable boats\u2014many of which capsized or were deflated leading to the loss of life,\" she said. \"The sea journey from the West African coastal states such as Senegal, Mauritania to the Canary Islands is long and perilous and can take up to 10 days. Many boats drifted off course or otherwise went missing without trace in these waters.\"\n\n\n\nMantoo pointed out that land routes also are highly dangerous, and even more people have died on journeys through the Sahara Desert and remote border areas than on the sea.\n\n\n\nShe said many people are subjected to horrific forms of abuse at the hands of smugglers or traffickers, armed and criminal gangs, and sometimes by law enforcement authorities.\n\n\n\n\"Among the litany of abuses reported by people traveling these routes are extrajudicial killings, unlawful and arbitrary detention, sexual and gender-based violence, forced labor, slavery, forced marriage and other gross human rights violations,\" Mantoo said. \"UNHCR warns that continued political instability and conflicts, deteriorating socioeconomic conditions, as well as the impact of climate change, may increase displacement and dangerous onward movements.\"\n\n\n\nThe UNHCR is calling for support to provide credible alternatives to the dangerous journeys. It is appealing for $163.5 million to provide increased humanitarian assistance and solutions for people who need international protection.\n\n\n\nThe appeal covers some 25 countries in four regions. All are connected by the same land and sea routes used by migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. The UNHCR aims to provide essential services and protection to people on the move or stranded on route, intercepted at sea, or held in detention."

The Spanish coast guard rescued 36 people from the stricken dinghy.\n\nThe Spanish coast guard said Tuesday April 26 that it had rescued 36 people from a capsized dinghy around 250 kilometers south of the Canary Islands. Earlier, a spokesperson had said there were 34 survivors. The coast guard had been alerted on Sunday to a boat that had left Cabo Bojador in Western Sahara, with around 61 migrants on board, news agencies reported.\n\nOne person was confirmed to have died, and 25 others remain missing.\n\nMigrants continue to risk the dangerous Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands, resulting in rising numbers of recorded deaths at sea | Source: Screengrab from Reuters video\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survivors, including two minors, arrived at Gran Canaria\u2019s Arguineguin port at about 10 am on Tuesday, according to Reuters. All of them were from sub-Saharan Africa, the coast guard said.\n\nThe Spanish NGO Caminando Fronteras, which helps migrant boats in distress, initially reported that 27 people had died, the group's founder Helena Maleno describing the incident on Twitter as a terrible tragedy. She later revised the number to 25 people, seven of them babies.\n\nDespertamos con una terrible tragedia : veintisiete personas, entre ellas trece mujeres y seis beb\u00e9s, mueren tras volcar la patera en la que viajaban.

An additional 1,153 were reported dead or missing on the Northwest African maritime route to the Canary Islands.\n\n\u201cMost of the sea crossings took place in packed, unseaworthy, inflatable boats \u2013 many of which capsised or were deflated leading to the loss of life,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe dead and missing came from various North and sub-Saharan African countries including Tunisia, Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Eritrea, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Senegal, as well as Iran, Syria and Afghanistan, Mantoo said.\n\nThe tolls do not include those lost along land routes such as through the punishing Sahara Desert nor those lost in smuggler-run detention centres where survivors have reported sexual violence and forced marriage and labour.\n\nUNHCR noted that an additional 478 people have died or gone missing at sea since the beginning of 2022 and called for \u201curgent support to prevent deaths and protect refugees and asylum seekers who are embarking on dangerous journeys by land and sea\u201d.\n\nNeed for \u2018credible alternatives to dangerous journeys\u2019\n\nThe agency appealed for $163.5m in support to help provide alternatives to the perilous boat journeys and prevent individuals from becoming the victims of human traffickers who operate on the routes to Europe.\n\n\u201cThe appeal covers some 25 countries across four different regions connected by the same land and sea routes which are used by migrants, asylum seekers and refugees,\u201d it said, adding the group includes countries of origin, departure, first asylum, transit, and destination.\n\nUNHCR also urged governments to introduce enhanced \u201clegal frameworks and operational capacities at land and sea borders and in urban centres, and to ensure credible alternatives to dangerous journeys through inclusion, and strengthened youth programming and local community-based development\u201d.\n\n\u201cStates must ensure unimpeded humanitarian access for the delivery of essential services to people on the move or stranded en route, intercepted at sea, or held in detention centres, and to determine whether they have international protection needs,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cFailing this, refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced people and others will continue to move onwards in dangerous journeys in search of safety and protection.\n\n\u201cOther people, including migrants, will move onwards to seek a better life, hoping to find work or educational opportunities elsewhere in the absence of sufficient seasonal or longer-term legal pathways for safe and orderly migration.\u201d\n\nEuropean countries, many of which have opened their borders for Ukrainians fleeing war, have been criticised for their double standards in dealing with migrants and refugees from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, the head of the European Union\u2019s border agency Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, offered to resign after accusations the body mistreated migrants and refugees on the external frontiers of the bloc.\n\nA report by the UN\u2019s rights office last year said that the EU was partly to blame for deaths in the Mediterranean due to unanswered distress calls and the obstruction of humanitarian rescue efforts."

The UNHCR report showed that 53,323 migrants arrived by boat in Italy last year - an 83% hike over 2020.\n\nIn addition, 23,042 arrived in the Canary Islands, nearly the same number as a year earlier, the report mentioned.\n\nThe report also noted a 61% increase in departures from Tunisia compared to 2020, while departures from Libya increased by 150%. They took the Central Mediterranean route, which is the world's deadliest.\n\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration, more than 17,000 people have died or gone missing along this route since 2014.\n\n\"A myriad of abuses\" along these routes\n\nThe UNHCR cautioned that land routes were also \"highly dangerous\".\n\n\"Even greater numbers may have died on journeys through the Sahara desert and remote border areas, in detention centres, or while in the captivity of smugglers or traffickers,\" Mantoo highlighted.\n\nMigrants along all of these routes face a \"litany of abuses,\" she indicated, pointing to \"extrajudicial killings, unlawful and arbitrary detention, sexual and gender-based violence, forced labour, slavery (and) forced marriage.\"\n\nAlongside the release of its report, the UN refugee agency launched an appeal for $163.5 million to help provide protection and solutions for refugees and others traveling along the dangerous routes to Europe.\n\n\"UNHCR is appealing for support to help provide meaningful alternatives to these dangerous journeys and prevent people from becoming victims of traffickers,\" Mantoo confirmed."

However, according to Helena Maleno, the founder of the NGO Caminando Fronteras, 44 migrants died after their boat sank off Cape Boujdour, Western Sahara.\n\n\"Seven bodies were transferred to the morgue and the other victims were swallowed by the sea,\" she added on Twitter. Twelve other migrants survived the sinking and were arrested, according to the same source.\n\nHelena Malenon did not specify the destination of the boat, but migrant boats departing from this area usually head for the Spanish archipelago of the Canaries. Located at the north-western tip of Africa, Morocco is a transit country for many migrants seeking to reach Europe from its Atlantic or Mediterranean coasts.\n\nAccording to figures from the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, more than 14,700 attempted illegal departures were prevented and 52 smuggling networks dismantled in Morocco during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn 2021, 4,404 migrants died or disappeared during their sea crossing to Spain, the worst toll since 2015, according to Caminando Fronteras, which keeps track of these migration tragedies thanks to calls from migrants or their relatives on its emergency numbers.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Spanish Interior Ministry, more than 40,000 migrants, mostly from Morocco, arrived in the country by sea in 2021, as well as in the Balearic and Canary Islands."

Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, the head of the Black Sea Fleet is understood to have been detained by Russia after the ship was destroyed. The Deputy Commander of the fleet Captain 1st Rank Andrei Paliy died in Ukraine in March.

The cause of death has not been revealed and it is thought he died during Ukrainian attacks on the ship last month, though this has not been confirmed. The Governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev spoke to Russia\u2019s TASS news organisation, and he confirmed Chirva\u2019s death.
