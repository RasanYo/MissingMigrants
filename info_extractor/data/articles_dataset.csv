Accor­ding to the sur­vi­vors, the Greek coast guard ves­sel was towing the boat toward the Tur­ki­sh coast at high speed when the boat cap­si­zed. Sur­vi­vors tell that they were crying out for help, given that a lar­ge num­ber of child­ren and babies were on board.

In con­trast to the survivors’s accounts, the Greek Port Aut­ho­ri­ty has alle­ged that due to bad wea­ther con­di­ti­ons the Coast Guard had laun­ched a res­cue ope­ra­ti­on to tow the boat toward the Greek island of Farm­a­ko­ni­si. Accor­ding to the Greek aut­ho­ri­ties, during the ope­ra­ti­on a lar­ge num­ber of tho­se on board gathe­red on one side of the boat, which resul­ted in its over­tur­ning and sinking.

“It is high­ly likely that this action by the Greek coast guard was an ille­gal push-back ope­ra­ti­on rather than a res­cue at sea “ said Karl Kopp, Direc­tor of Euro­pean Affairs of Pro Asyl.

In a report published in Novem­ber, Pro Asyl detail­ed how refu­gees attemp­ting to cross the EU’s exter­nal bor­ders with Tur­key are sys­te­ma­ti­cal­ly pushed back from Greek ter­ri­to­ri­al waters, the Greek islands and from the land bor­der. The Pro Asyl report spe­ci­fi­cal­ly out­lined vio­la­ti­ons that had occur­red on or in the pro­xi­mi­ty of Farmakonisi.

Having taken con­trol of the boat, the Greek aut­ho­ri­ties took respon­si­bi­li­ty for tho­se on board. Pro Asyl and ECRE call for an inde­pen­dent and effec­ti­ve inves­ti­ga­ti­on of the cir­cum­s­tances that cau­sed such loss of life. The NGOs rei­te­ra­te that push-backs are ille­gal, end­an­ger people’s lives and have to end immediately.

“The­se are Euro­pean bor­ders, mana­ged with Euro­pean money, and with the sup­port of the EU bor­der agen­cy Fron­tex. The EU has a respon­si­bi­li­ty to take all mea­su­res nee­ded to ensu­re that life is given prio­ri­ty and fun­da­men­tal rights are respec­ted at its bor­ders”, said ECRE’s Secre­ta­ry Gene­ral Micha­el Died­ring. “At the time of the Greek Pre­si­den­cy all efforts should be taken to pro­tect life and stop the­se human rights violations”.

During this night, three people were trying cross the border to the UK by hiding inside a lorry. As they entered the truck they realized that the truck driver clearly saw them entering. So they were quite surprised when the driver did not say anything and shortly after drove off.

After around a 15 minute drive the truck stopped at a small parking space. The driver went to the back of the truck to shout to the people inside to come out. Because they were hiding behind boxes they had to climb over them to get out, but they could not get out quick enough.

The truck started driving while they were still trying to get out. Finally they made it to the back to jump out of the truck. In the meantime the truck was already back on the highway! Two of them were lucky and landed on their feet and could leave the highway. The third person was not that lucky. He landed on his head and could not move. Even if the other two tried to stop the traffic on the street, they could not help him. A second truck which passed hit the young boy and it tore him to pieces.

We are deeply shocked about another very tragic and brutal death here in Calais. The two people with him that night are of course very distraught. They witnessed him dying. Trying to cross to England is not an option for them any more. They left their home to find peace and protection. And they do not want to be the next one killed instead by the European border regime!

This is now the fourth death at the Calais border in the past 6 months; and at least the twenty second reported death in the past four years.

There is no justification for the countless suffering inflicted on people by the border regimes. People without the ‘right’ identity in this world have to risk their lives day in and day out while the privileged class pass by in luxury.

The greed of the capitalist trade assigns more value to the goods – taken from every corner of the world – in the 7,000 trucks that cross daily into Britain than the people having to hide amongst them.

These regimes are a brutal combination of age old racism tied up with the mantra of ‘national interest’ where people profiting from the system are quite happy to reap all the benefits of the global militarized onslaught to ‘free up’ capital and trade but are not willing to share any of the benefits or bear any of the consequences.

ID controls and the enforcement of identity papers, check points and prisons used to control the identity of populations has, and always will, result in persecution. Time and time again ID controls by authorities scanning populations in order to pick out certain categories of people is a telling sign that systematic abuse against those people is happening.

And the silence remains deafening. One death is too many. It will stop only when people rise up to make it stop. Regimes do not give up their control voluntarily.

They were found in the waters off South Ocean Lane in Fort Lauderdale just before 8 a.m. That's just north of Port Everglades Inlet.

Fort Lauderdale police say a person living at the Lago Mar Beachside Resort spotted the migrants when they arrived. Some of the people who arrived were wearing life jackets and swam to shore.

The Coast Guard says 8 people -- 7 women and one man -- were taken into custody.

Another man who was found in the water was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

""It was pretty weird, surreal for sure,"" sais Marco Arroyo

Arroyo and his friends say they were surfing, when they spotted three of the migrants as they washed up on the beach. Two of them were women. One appeared to be a young man.

""I saw three people get pulled out. One was unconscious. It was not a pretty sight,"" said Mike, another witness. ""The woman seemed OK. She was moving and walked herself out of the water when they got her to shore.""

But they say the young man was not as lucky.

""He looked like a teenager, maybe 15 or 16,"" said Justin Starrett. ""They put him on the truck to resuscitate him and just took him out.""

It's believed the migrants came from Haiti but it's unclear how long they were out in the open ocean.

""I wish hey had known the conditions today,"" said Mike. Because it wasn't a good day to go out on those waters.""

""It's really rough. If you don't know how to swim, or what you're doing, you're in trouble,"" Starrett said."

CNN —

A U.S. Border Patrol agent has shot and killed an apparently undocumented migrant who allegedly threw rocks at the agent, striking his face, on the California-Mexico border near San Diego, authorities said.

A social justice advocacy group on Wednesday criticized the Border Patrol’s use of deadly force in the Tuesday incident, saying there’s a disturbing trend of Border Patrol “killings of rock throwers, some of whom were teenagers and some whom were U.S. citizens” on the U.S.-Mexico border, said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego.

The Border Patrol declined to comment directly on this week’s incident, which is under investigation by local authorities, but in the past, the agency has highlighted how agents are seriously injured in rock-throwing incidents and resort to lethal force to protect themselves.

Guerrero said, however, some police experts advise using nonlethal force such as pepper-ball guns to respond to rock throwings.

“Border agents should adhere to best policing practices and only use lethal force as a last resort, not the only resort,” Guerrero said.

In the San Diego sector on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Border Patrol has recorded more than 400 assaults, including rock throwings, on agents since 2010. The numbers have fluctuated in recent years, from 130 assaults in 2010, 77 in 2011, 133 in 2012 to 73 in 2013, according to the agency’s statistics.

Names of the agent and the apparently undocumented migrant in this week’s deadly encounter haven’t been released by authorities.

Rock-throwing incidents have been controversial on the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when Mexicans have thrown projectiles from the Mexico side of the international line toward Border Patrol agents on the U.S. side.

In some cases, U.S. Border Patrol agents have fired their guns at the rock throwers on the Mexico side of the border, killing the rock thrower. Mexican officials have condemned the Border Patrol’s use of lethal force as excessive.

The U.S. Border Patrol said the incident occurred in a rugged section of the Otay Mountains near San Diego where the agent was trying to arrest several immigrants who crossed the border illegally.

“During the attack the agent was struck in the head with a rock,” the Border Patrol said in a statement. “Fearing for his life the agent discharged his service issued weapon resulting in the death of one assailant.”

Two other undocumented migrants were arrested and in custody, the agency said.

The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, which is investigating the killing, said in its account that two Border Patrol agents were trying to detain a group of suspected undocumented migrants in rugged terrain in the mountain’s White Cross area about four mile east of the Otay Mesa border crossing.

“The two agents were out of sight of each other when one of the agents was struck in the face by a rock thrown by one of the suspects,” Lt. Glenn Giannantonio said in a statement. “Fearing for his safety, the agent fired his duty pistol at the man, striking him. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.”

The border patrol agent who fired his service weapon suffered minor injuries, the sheriff’s homicide unit said."

Spokesman Adrian Edwards said UNHCR was ""deeply saddened"" by the boat accident in the Gulf of Aden involving refugees and migrants. The boat was reportedly carrying 77 men, women and children from Somalia (31) and Ethiopia (46). ""Thirty-three people were rescued, but the remaining 44 are still missing and feared drowned,"" Edwards said.

The boat is reported to have departed early last Friday from Bossasso in Puntland on the north coast of Somalia. It ran into strong winds and high waves off the coast of the southern Yemeni governorate of Shabwa. According to one of the survivors, the boat quickly filled with water and capsized.

On Sunday morning a marine patrol by UNHCR partner organization, the Society for Humanitarian Solidarity (SHS), found a number of survivors. Thirty-two people were picked up by early afternoon, and one more later in the day. Other passengers remain missing.

Edwards said that all but one of the survivors was male. They were brought ashore at Majdaha by SHS staff and given first aid, food, water and clothing before being taken to a transit centre. ""One 45-year-old man from southern Somalia said he has lost his two children in the tragedy, unable to reach them in the dark. The sole surviving woman lost her teenage daughter. She said the smugglers had refused to stop the boat when it began taking on water,"" Edwards added.

The tragedy is the most significant involving refugees and migrants crossing the sea to Yemen in the past year. The number of people making the perilous journey has been declining. From 107,532 arrivals in 2012 the number fell to 65,319 in 2013, and only 2,717 are recorded in the first two months of this year.

""Nonetheless, the crossings continue and lives are being lost. And this calls for all stakeholders - governments, international and regional organizations, the donor community and civil society - to develop comprehensive responses to reduce and ultimately prevent these hazardous journeys,"" Edwards stressed.

Over the past five years, more than half-a-million people (mainly Somalis, Ethiopians and Eritreans) have crossed the dangerous waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to reach Yemen. Reports abound of mistreatment, abuse, rape and torture by unscrupulous smuggling and trafficking rings. Boats crossing to Yemen are overcrowded, and smugglers have reportedly thrown passengers overboard to prevent capsizing or avoid detection. Search-and-rescue officials say the practice has resulted in hundreds of undocumented casualties in recent years.

UNHCR has urged countries in the region to implement measures to help identify refugees and other people with protection needs among those taking to the sea. UNHCR has also called on donor countries and civil society organizations to become more engaged in mixed-migration issues in the Horn of Africa, so as to improve humanitarian responses and help save lives.

The refugee agency has worked to enhance services offered to new arrivals in close collaboration with the Mixed Migration Task Force and other partners, including the government of Yemen, international and national non-governmental organizations and host communities at arrival points."

Ultimate price: Ethiopian Senay Berthay was one of four killed

Charities say there are more than 600 in the town, the greatest number since the closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence.

On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port.

The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter.

It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

A French police spokesman said: ‘The Polish driver heard a noise and stopped suddenly. One of the vehicles on board his truck backed into the stowaway and killed him. He was left lying in a pool of blood.’

Desperate to come to Britain: Some truckers are taking long detours to cross the Channel to avoid Calais, where aid workers describe 'catastrophic' scenes

But fatalities and failed attempts do nothing to weaken the remaining migrants’ resolve to reach Britain.

When asked why they were trying to board the lorries, one told the Mail: ‘We have to go to your country. Take me to England.’

Most of the migrants are sleeping in the main camp on a disused railway line just beside the main port where ferries go to Dover.

Men gathered for several hours at the junction near the port, relentlessly trying to break into vehicles or get underneath to sit on the axle, but police did nothing. When a force car passed by it did not stop and no attempt was made to apprehend the men.

In wait: More migrants hide behind a wall near the port

At a second location, migrants were able to get beyond the port’s perimeter fence by freely walking through an unmanned entrance before climbing up on a bank beside the road that lorries have to drive down to get on to the ferries.

The men were witnessed crouching down at the side of the road, which is inside the port, before jumping out and trying to get on to lorries when they were forced to slow down because of a build-up of traffic.

British lorry drivers, who are fined £2,000 if found carrying an illegal migrant, said ‘extremely light-touch’ policing by the French meant they were ‘sitting ducks’ for those wanting to smuggle themselves across the Channel.

Ahmed, 31, from Afghanistan, who is one of the migrants sleeping in more than 100 tents in the camp, said he was confident he would get to Britain.

‘I will get there – I have to. I have lived in countries throughout Europe since I left Afghanistan five years ago, but Britain is where I want to be,’ he said.

‘We either try to get in the back of lorries, or get underneath and on to the axle depending on how many seconds we think we have when they stop at junctions or have to slow down on the road into the port.’

Another Afghan man, 38-year-old Sardar Wali, said: ‘The police do not stop us. Even if you get caught, the police let you go, and you can try again.’

Lorry driver Keith Taylor, 57, said he does not believe French police have any desire to stop migrants getting on to vehicles going to Britain, adding: ‘They just turn a blind eye. Why would they try to stop them?

'They do not want them living here. I do not stop my lorry here if I am on my way to Dover as it is too risky. If you stop anywhere, you know they will try and break in.

Familiar tactic: A gang tries but fails to get into one lorry at port in Calais

... so they race to try their luck on another

‘Even if you drive straight into the port they can get on. They just walk straight through into the port and then when the lorries are backed up you are a sitting duck.’

Fellow driver Mick Short, 38, added: ‘It is dangerous what they are doing and being able to get away with. They need more police and better security to stop them. They can get on your lorry and you have no clue.

‘The problem is, if we get caught with one of them on the lorry we get fined £2,000 per immigrant. At the moment the policing in Calais is extremely light-touch. You hardly ever see them out on patrol.’

A French police spokesman said: ‘[The migrants] put themselves in extremely dangerous positions – this is the direct result.’

He refused to comment on ‘specific areas for operational reasons’, but said, ‘all areas are well covered to ensure maximum security’.

But Philippe Mignonet, Calais’s deputy mayor, said he believes between ten and 30 stowaways cross the Channel each day.

He told the Mail: ‘It’s a difficult situation. We know why these people are in Calais, they want to go to England.’"

At a second location, migrants were able to get beyond the port’s perimeter fence by freely walking through an unmanned entrance before climbing up on a bank beside the road that lorries have to drive down to get on to the ferries.

The men were witnessed crouching down at the side of the road, which is inside the port, before jumping out and trying to get on to lorries when they were forced to slow down because of a build-up of traffic.

British lorry drivers, who are fined £2,000 if found carrying an illegal migrant, said ‘extremely light-touch’ policing by the French meant they were ‘sitting ducks’ for those wanting to smuggle themselves across the Channel.

Ahmed, 31, from Afghanistan, who is one of the migrants sleeping in more than 100 tents in the camp, said he was confident he would get to Britain.

‘I will get there – I have to. I have lived in countries throughout Europe since I left Afghanistan five years ago, but Britain is where I want to be,’ he said.

‘We either try to get in the back of lorries, or get underneath and on to the axle depending on how many seconds we think we have when they stop at junctions or have to slow down on the road into the port.’

Another Afghan man, 38-year-old Sardar Wali, said: ‘The police do not stop us. Even if you get caught, the police let you go, and you can try again.’

Lorry driver Keith Taylor, 57, said he does not believe French police have any desire to stop migrants getting on to vehicles going to Britain, adding: ‘They just turn a blind eye. Why would they try to stop them?

'They do not want them living here. I do not stop my lorry here if I am on my way to Dover as it is too risky. If you stop anywhere, you know they will try and break in.

‘Even if you drive straight into the port they can get on. They just walk straight through into the port and then when the lorries are backed up you are a sitting duck.’

Fellow driver Mick Short, 38, added: ‘It is dangerous what they are doing and being able to get away with. They need more police and better security to stop them. They can get on your lorry and you have no clue.

‘The problem is, if we get caught with one of them on the lorry we get fined £2,000 per immigrant. At the moment the policing in Calais is extremely light-touch. You hardly ever see them out on patrol.’

EU migration 'will bring enough people to fill Manchester every four years'

Blind to the danger, a gang of would-be immigrants run to board a moving lorry.

To them it is a passport to a new life in Britain. In fact it is a potential death trap.

Four other migrants died in just one week in Calais, it emerged last night, and scenes like the one pictured are being repeated every day at the French port.

Crisis point: A British truck driver claims his colleagues have been attacked and stabbed by 'intimidating' gangs of migrants in Calais

The dramatic images were captured as an ominous report by MigrationWatch:



* Warned immigration from the EU will bring enough people to fill a city the size of Manchester here every four years;

* Called for ministers to deny migrants access to Britain’s generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, for the first five years they are here.

In Calais, hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of the port.

Ultimate price: Ethiopian Senay Berthay was one of four killed

Charities say there are more than 600 in the town, the greatest number since the closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 – and they are taking advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence.

On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port.

The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter.

It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

A French police spokesman said: ‘The Polish driver heard a noise and stopped suddenly. One of the vehicles on board his truck backed into the stowaway and killed him. He was left lying in a pool of blood.’

Desperate to come to Britain: Some truckers are taking long detours to cross the Channel to avoid Calais, where aid workers describe 'catastrophic' scenes

But fatalities and failed attempts do nothing to weaken the remaining migrants’ resolve to reach Britain.

When asked why they were trying to board the lorries, one told the Mail: ‘We have to go to your country. Take me to England.’

Most of the migrants are sleeping in the main camp on a disused railway line just beside the main port where ferries go to Dover.

Men gathered for several hours at the junction near the port, relentlessly trying to break into vehicles or get underneath to sit on the axle, but police did nothing. When a force car passed by it did not stop and no attempt was made to apprehend the men.

Rescue services, alerted by a passing Turkish cargo ship, pulled two bodies from the waters off the island of Lesbos and another five from a semi-sunken boat.

Eight other migrants were rescued and two were missing. The merchant marine ministry mounted a search and rescue operation involving coastguard vessels, a naval helicopter and passenger ferries.

The island's chief forensic pathologist, Theodoros Nostias, said of the seven dead: ""They're been brought to the morgue and among them are a four-year-old girl and 47-year-old man. Documents show that they are all from Syria.""

Mobilising coastguard vessels, a naval helicopter and passenger ferries, Athens's merchant marine ministry mounted a search and rescue operation throughout the day for two migrants who remained missing. ""We managed to save eight but two are still unaccounted for,"" said Despoina Navrasoglou, a spokeswoman at the ministry. ""We're also scouring the shores of Mytilene [Lesbos]. We're using every means possible. We want to find them.""

Officials said the tragedy occurred when the group's fibreglass boat started to take on water as it approached the island's northern coast en route from Turkey shortly after midnight. ""From the testimonies that we have, we know it went down very quickly,"" one official said.

Greece has been heavily criticised in the past for its handling of asylum seekers. Human rights organisations have reported an alarming rise of deaths in the Aegean, amid accusations of pushbacks by the Greek coastguard under pressure to protect what is widely perceived as one of Europe's leakiest borders.

In January, 12 immigrants – mostly women and children – drowned when their vessel capsized near Farmakonisi, an uninhabited isle in the eastern Aegean. Survivors claimed that the boat overturned as it was being tugged at high speed by coastguard officers intent on dragging it back into Turkey's territorial waters.

Accounts of the incident elicited a rare admission of guilt from the coastguard chief, Vice-Admiral Dimitris Bandias, who told parliament: ""We apologise to the families and to all Greeks, too, for the situation that we put them in.""

With the arrival of spring and improved weather conditions, immigration experts warned the influx was bound to grow in the coming months. ""There are clear cycles of very low levels of irregular migration across the Aegean Sea in the winter and much higher levels in the spring and summer,"" said Martin Baldwin-Edwards, who heads the Mediterranean Migration Observatory in Athens.

""So it is almost certain that we will see more of these tragedies in the months ahead even if there are also signs that Greece has begun to be overtaken by Bulgaria, where patrols are lighter, as the preferred route for migrants seeking entrance to Europe."""

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano has urged the EU to ""take the situation in hand.""

Italy said on Wednesday that bids by thousands of boat migrants to cross the Mediterranean from northern Africa had become ""glaring"" with many more waiting in Libya.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that two merchant ships had rescued two boatloads carrying 300 and 361 people early on Wednesday. At least one dead body was discovered on board, he said.

Alfano demanded that the EU do more than just hand funds to its border agency Frontex.

""There are death merchants who profit from this human trafficking and who send out requests for help just 30 to 40 miles after leaving the Libyan coasts,"" Alfano said.

Policy overhaul awaited

Late last year, Italy began a naval operation to spot migrant boats in transit after more than 400 migrants from Eritrea and Syria perished just off Italy's southern-most island of Lampedusa.

That tragedy prompted calls for an overhaul of European migration and asylum policies, which culminated at an EU-Africa summit in Brussels last week in joint promises to try new approaches.

The EU and the African Union said they would ""upscale efforts"" to tackle ""irregular migration"" by focusing instead on development and education in Africa, combined with crackdowns on people traffickers.

Thousands perished

Migrant advocacy groups estimate that between 17,000 and 20,000 migrants have died at sea while trying to reach ""fortress Europe"" in the past 20 years.

Alfano estimated that so far this year 15,000 migrants had been rescued.

An estimated 1,000 have already reached Spain in the first three months of this year crossing from Morocco into two Spanish enclaves in northern Africa - Melilla and Ceuta.

Migrants from central and western Africa converged on Morocco and then tried to scale the enclaves' high barbed-wire fences, often enduring deep cuts to their hands and feet.

""As long as there is such a big difference in wealth and there are problems in Africa, there will always be immigration,"" said Adil Akkid of the Moroccan Assocation of Human Rights.

Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for ""greater commitment"" to deal with pressure on Ceuta and Melilla.

Once on European territory, would-be migrants face repatriation or often long procedural waits if they apply for asylum.

The fight last Friday involved a shootout in which two Vietnamese border guards were killed after one or more migrants in the group, which had been stopped by guards at a sentry building, seized one or more AK-47 assault rifles and opened fire, Vietnamese state news media reported over the weekend.

As Vietnamese security forces surrounded the multistory building, some of the Chinese migrants committed suicide by leaping off the roof, and others were shot dead, the reports said. A photograph of the four women and two children in the 16-person group showed women wearing scarves over their faces, a manner of dress common among the more conservative ethnic Uighur women in the Chinese region of Xinjiang.

Uighurs complain of harassment and discrimination in China, and many have fled to Southeast Asia. Last month, at least 400 people believed to be Uighurs were stopped in various parts of Thailand. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have urged the Thai government to not return them to China."

UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told journalists in Geneva that at least 17 people drowned after a boat sank on Monday in international waters, some 160 kilometres south of the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa and around 80 km north-west of Tripoli, Libya. The dead included 12 women, three children and two men.

Edwards added that two merchant ships from France and Vanuatu rescued 226 people who later received medical checks from Italian doctors. The French vessel, Bourbon Arcadia, rescued 158 people and the Kehoe Tide from Vanuatu rescued 68 people.

Yesterday's tragedy follows several shipwrecks off the Libyan coast over the past fortnight in which 121 people are believed to have died in three separate boat accidents. The Libyan coast guard has rescued 134 people, the UNHCR spokesman said. The survivors receive medical assistance from UNHCR, the International Medical Corps and the Libyan coast guard. UNHCR also provides clothing, mattresses and other relief items.

""The other shipwrecks we know of, include one that took place off Libya around May 6 when a boat carrying 130 people capsized some 30 minutes into the journey, just a few miles from the coast,"" Edwards said. Some of the 53 survivors told UNHCR that the smugglers set off even though the boat was damaged.

As of Monday, the coast guard had recovered 44 bodies believed to be from the same shipwreck, with a further 33 missing and believed dead. The people on board were from Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan.

On May 2, the Libyan coast guard rescued 80 people from Eritrean, Ethiopia and Somalia after their boat started leaking. Another four people drowned in the incident. Two days earlier, the Libyan coast guard found the wreckage of another boat off the coast of Tripoli. The sole survivor, in a critical condition, was treated at a government hospital; the remaining 40 passengers – all from Somalia – had drowned.

Shipwreck victims and survivors include people fleeing violence or persecution in their homelands and the risks they take on these sea journeys reflect the limited safe options available in Libya and other contexts. UNHCR has launched an information campaign in association with the Libyan coast guard, NGOs, UN partners and asylum-seekers to inform people of the risks involved with unscheduled voyages by sea.

""UNHCR welcomes the rescue operations by Italian and Libyan authorities and the cooperation of private vessels, without which the death toll would have been undoubtedly higher, but asks that search and rescue operations are further strengthened, especially in waters that have a high number of incidents,"" Edwards stressed.

""We also urge governments around the world to provide legal alternatives to dangerous sea journeys, ensuring desperate people in need of refuge can seek and find protection and asylum,"" he added. These alternatives could include resettlement, humanitarian admission, and facilitated access to family reunification. Governments are also asked to resist punitive or deterrent measures such as detention for people seeking safety.

The other boys travelled further for 1 1/2 hours; later the lorry stopped and they went down, thinking he was still alive; while walking back they were picked up by police who told them their friend had died. They are very upset and in shock.

The family has been informed. There is a collection to send the body home to Eritrea, donations much needed.

There was a circle at the food distribution in memory of Mengs. Migrants of all communities attended. Everybody is very upset and angry. There were prayers, and speeches. Some blamed the authorities and border controls for the death of Mengs, and want to have a demonstration. Later there was the vigil at the Eritrean camp, attended by so many people.

But for this young person from Sudan there was no ‘legal’ or safe passage to go to England. Criminalised because of his identity he had to risk his life to cross.

Having already survived the murderous overland journey escaping Sudan to travel into Europe, he is killed at the last border.

This is now the 8th reported death in Calais so far this year; the 5th resulting from fatalities from trucks.

Most tourists pass through Calais blind to the struggle of people without papers. For those with papers the border does not exist; the privileged class can pass. While those without papers must risk their life to enter.

Every year thousands of people try to escape Sudan in hope of a better life. The Sudanese people have been under decades of dictatorship from one of the most brutal regimes in the world. The Sudanese government continues to unleash a systematic policy of ethnic cleansing and genocide that has destroyed 90% of black African villages in Darfur, and increasingly attacks people in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and creating millions of refugees across Sudan.

People who have already suffered so much, only face more harassment and abuse from the gate-keepers upholding the borders to Fortress Europe.

From the Sahara to the Mediterranean through to Calais, uncountable lives are wasted. Whether from the direct attacks by police and border forces, or in the attempt to escape their controls, or through the dangerous methods of transit.

The tighter the border controls get the more dangerous the methods to cross become.

In Calais people from areas such as Sudan are more likely to try to cross by hiding on the axle under a bus because they do not have the money to pay mafia who control many of the parking areas and put people inside the trucks.

And the response and logic of those maintaining the border is to fortify their controls and keep trying to push people out of existence.

Modern-day fascism, enforced by border and riot robo-cops and their surveillance systems, can only be made possible by the cross-border collaboration between governments, companies and industries that profit from them.

These deaths will not be silenced and will never be forgotten. People will continue the daily fight for survival against the death wish of the border regimes!

Tear down the fences, tear down the walls!

THERE IS NO FREEDOM UNTIL THERE IS FREEDOM FOR ALL!

In a separate incident, four migrants from the Central African Republic fell from a rope ladder connecting a merchant ship with their stricken vessel and were swept away, according to the ship's captain.

“The vessel carrying them sank under unspecified circumstances,” a Coast Guard spokeswoman said.

The Turkish Coast Guard found another two bodies, she added, while 20 more people from the Samos group are believed to be missing. Greek and Turkish authorities are still searching the area. Thirteen people have been rescued, including a woman and a teenage boy, who are being hospitalized. Many of the recent arrivals are escaping the civil war in Syria.

A shocking video revealed how residents of the island of Tilos, Greece, were trying to rescue immigrants in desperate need at the rocky shore near the Monastery of Agios Panteleimonas. People of all ages hanging off cliffs in order to help people struggling to swim to the shore during the strong winds prevailing at the time.

It is believed that the migrants were abandoned at the sharp cliffs off the coast of Tilos by their traffickers, without food or water. Local authorities and citizens were notified and immediately rushed to the spot for help.

Late on Saturday, another 17 migrants were rescued from the sea in another incident near the Greek island of Farmakonisi. And 77 more were found early Sunday in two separate parts near the island of Chios, after managing to land on the coast.

Since the beginning of the year, more than 9,500 migrants have been rescued at sea, while 113 traffickers have been arrested by Greek authorities. The number is double from 2013.

More than 260 people have died or been reported missing as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea towards Europe over the past ten days.

Survivors reported disturbing incidents of mass drownings, suffocations and a suspected multiple stabbing. The grim tally brings to some 800 the total number of deaths at sea this year, compared to a total 600 deaths in 2013, and 500 in 2012.

The tragedies mark an intensifying crisis on Europe's shores, as many fleeing Eritrea, Syria and other countries torn by violence seek safety in Europe by risking their lives at sea in the hand of smugglers. A rapid rise in incidents over recent weeks has prompted calls for urgent measures by European countries to develop a comprehensive plan to prevent such tragedies.

More than 75,000 refugees and migrants arrived in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta by sea in the first half of 2014 - 25 per cent more than the 60,000 who made the same journey in the whole of 2013, and over three times the 22,500 who arrived in all of 2012.

Italy received the greatest number of arrivals (63,884), followed by Greece (10,080), Spain (1,000) and Malta (227). A further 21,000 refugees and migrants have arrived in Italy since 1 July. The largest numbers came from Eritrea, Syria and Mali. Most left from North Africa, and principally Libya.

This included 10,563 children, 3,676 from Syria, who arrived in Italy in the first six months of 2014. 6,500 of the children, mostly Eritreans, were unaccompanied or separated from their families.

Over the weekend of 19-20 July alone, Italian and Maltese authorities, together with several commercial vessels, rescued 8,000 people.

António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, praised both countries for their efforts, but said European states needed to step up their assistance.

""The death of 260 people in less than ten days, in the most horrifying of circumstances, is evidence that the Mediterranean crisis is intensifying,"" Mr Guterres said. ""Europeans need to take urgent action to stop this catastrophe getting worse in the second half of 2014.""

Mr Guterres called on governments to strengthen rescue operations, provide swift access to asylum procedures for those in need of protection, and legal alternatives to dangerous sea crossings.

Rescued refugees and migrants have reported handing over their life savings to smugglers, in order to travel in unseaworthy and overcrowded dinghies, packed into a few metres of space without food, water or life jackets.

The journey can take between one to four days, depending on the weather, sea and boat conditions. In several incidents, people were stranded for more than two weeks before being rescued.

On 14 July, Italian authorities rescued 12 people 40 miles off the coast of Libya. Survivors said their rubber dinghy had been carrying 121 people. Passengers panicked when it started to deflate on one side, and it capsized. A total of 109 people are missing; with one man saying he lost his pregnant wife during the incident.

On 15 July, 29 people were found dead from apparent asphyxiation in the hold of a fishing boat, and details are emerging of a horrifying incident in which as many as 60 people were stabbed and thrown overboard as they sought to escape from the hold. A total of 131 people are missing and presumed dead from the incident, including a newborn baby. Italian police are reported to have arrested five men on Tuesday in connection with the incident.

UNHCR welcomes all efforts by European authorities, particularly in Italy, to rescue boats in distress in the Mediterranean, and calls on all states to continue to fulfil their obligations under international refugee law and the law of the sea. UNHCR recognizes the great support of shipmasters in the Mediterranean in carrying out rescue operations and asks them to remain vigilant and to continue to discharge their duty of rescuing vessels in distress

It also urges European countries to provide additional and better facilities to receive those rescued, and to identify longer-term solutions for refugees, including resettlement, admission based on humanitarian needs, admission schemes based on private sponsorship, facilitated access to family reunification and the use of programmes such as student or employment visas.

The boat, with 600 people on board, was intercepted south of the island of Lampedusa, Italy's southernmost point and a major landing point for migrant Mediterranean crossings from Libya as it is closer to Africa than mainland Italy.

Two more people have been evacuated by helicopter from the boat and been taken to Palermo hospital in Sicily in a serious condition, the report said.

The coastguard and navy could not be reached for comment.

ANSA said Italian authorities were first alerted by a merchant ship in the area, some 80 nautical miles (148 kilometres, 92 miles) from Lampedusa.

Meanwhile a merchant vessel, the Panamanian-flagged City of Sidon, arrived in Porto Empedocle port in Sicily yesterday with 61 migrants on board -- the survivors of another shipwreck tragedy close to Libyan waters.

Their rickety boat was intercepted on Thursday 36 nautical miles north of Tripoli and it sank as they were being rescued with 102 people on board, meaning that 41 are feared dead, ANSA reported.

The survivors were from Gambia, Ghana and Mali, it said.

Italian media yesterday also said a navy warship arrived in the port of Salerno with 2,186 migrants rescued in recent days, adding that they came from Egypt, Eritrea, Ghana, Somalia and Syria.

There has been a sharp rise in migrant landings in recent weeks because of the calm summer weather and growing lawlessness in Libya, with hundreds of migrants now being intercepted by Italian authorities every day.

Around 80,000 migrants are now believed to have landed in Italy so far this year -- higher than the previous record of some 60,000 arriving in 2011 at the height of the turmoil triggered by the Arab Spring revolutions.

Most of them come from Eritrea, Somalia and Syria but there are also asylum-seekers arriving from Afghanistan, Pakistan and other parts of Asia as well as sub-Saharan Africa.

Thousands have died in the crossings, either by drowning, dehydration or being suffocated by toxic fumes.

Earlier this month, Italian officials discovered the bodies of 45 migrants in the hold of a fishing boat, where they appeared to have suffocated after being locked in by traffickers."

The International Organization for Migration reports the boat started its journey with 750 migrants aboard and arrived with only 569, saying as many as 180 people are believed to have perished.

The voyage concluded Saturday with the Italian navy rescuing hundreds of migrants from the overcrowded smuggler’s boat.

Survivors then recounted tales of horrifying brutality, racism, discrimination and clashes among the different ethnic groups aboard the vessel.

A spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, Flavio di Giacomo, has interviewed about 25 survivors in a reception center in Sicily.

He says all are young men between the ages of 18 and 24 from Sub-Saharan Africa, and that all have been traumatized by the ordeal.

According to di Giacomo, the smugglers assigned migrants from Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Morocco places on the two upper decks where they could catch a sea breeze, while migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa were forced into the hold.

“They were forced [into the hold] by smugglers with knives; they were beaten by smugglers and they were cut — I actually saw cuts on their bodies — and to sit in the hold close to the engine .... a situation that is very dangerous, it is very painful because it is hot. There is no air. You can die — as happened, actually. But they had no other choice.""

Di Giacomo also said the Africans were beaten back when they tried to go to an upper deck to get fresh air, and that 29 migrants died from heat and asphyxiation after being forced to remain in the hold.

He says witnesses also told him that many of the migrants were kicked and stabbed and about 60 were thrown overboard.

Many of the African migrants aboard the boat were fleeing wars, religious persecution and collapsing economies in places such as Nigeria, Niger, Mali, Ivory Coast and Gambia.

“The smugglers, they are characterized also by very racist behavior toward African migrants ... while the other nationalities had life jackets,"" he said.

A search has started for missing people as the boat is thought to have been carrying around 80 people. The news of the the case disaster comes a day after another migrant-boat disaster in waters between Libya and Malta in which 29 people, including a small child, died.

More than 800 migrants were rescued overnight while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, the Italian navy said.

The latest rescue comes amid a surge in the number of migrants attempting to reach Europe from Africa, as traffickers take advantage of calm summer seas to make the dangerous crossing.

The navy said four of its boats were involved in the operation, which lasted through Sunday night and continued into Monday, together with a merchant ship that happened to be in the area.

It said 824 migrants were rescued from an assortment of dinghies, rafts and other boats - among them at least 91 women and 14 children.

In the biggest operation, a navy frigate rescued 294 migrants, including 28 women and nine children, from three dinghies.

The same frigate was involved in the rescue of another boat that was ""on the verge of sinking"", the navy said in a statement, adding that five bodies were recovered.

Two of those rescued were transported by helicopter to a hospital in Catania, Sicily.

The navy said a total of 1,771 migrants have been rescued in Italian territorial waters in recent days, adding that the search for more people continued on Monday.

On Saturday, Maltese authorities made the grim discovery of 30 bodies in the hold of a vessel that was carrying migrants across the Mediterranean.

Maltese officials said the migrants - almost all Syrian - may have died in a stampede as the boat was being rescued, while Italian officials said they may have been overcome with toxic fumes from the engine.

After two months of living in limbo in Calais and half a day hanging inches from death, Ahmed Osman must have felt that his 3,000-mile journey from Eritrea to join his older brother Jamal on English soil had finally come to a happy end.

At some point on 23 July this year - most probably in the car park of a shopping centre in the French port popular with British holidaymakers wanting to stock up on cheap wine - the 17-year-old slid himself under a gold-painted coach belonging to a Norfolk-based transport company, D&H Harrod Ltd.

For the next 12 hours, the slight teenager clung on in an impossibly narrow cavity between the floor of the coach and its rear axle and drive shaft as it returned to England carrying a contingent of schoolchildren. All that stopped Ahmed from falling into the whirling machinery beneath him was the leather belt from around his trousers which he used to buckle himself to a metal beam on the chassis.

At 1.15am on 24 July, Ahmed began to crawl his way back out of his hiding place, slowly inching through the guts of the coach towards the floor of the D&H Harrod depot on a disused airfield outside the town of Downham Market and, ultimately, a reunion with his sibling.

Among his meagre possessions was the mobile phone which he must have intended to use to make the joyful call declaring that, after a three-month journey traversing the Sahara and the Mediterranean, he had arrived.

It was not to be.

The 90-minute standstill which Ahmed had interpreted as the end of his odyssey was in fact a break while the coach driver, Robert Evans, cleaned the vehicle after its three-day school trip to northern France ready for its next journey later that morning.

Mr Evans then climbed back into this driver’s seat to complete his final task of the night - reversing the coach into position so it could be driven straight from the depot. After checking that his rear view mirrors and a dashboard-mounted camera were clear, he began the manoeuvre.

In a written account of the events of that warm, cloudless night, the coach driver with 38 years’ experience said: “I am very familiar with how my coach feels when it is moving along the road. While reversing on this particular occasion, I felt a slight resistance. It was something that only lasted a brief moment.

“I thought perhaps the brakes had stuck on or perhaps the air was low in the tanks. I remember just looking at the gauges and thinking they seemed OK. It was only when I turned the coach that I saw the body lying in the yard.”

The final horrifying moments of Ahmed’s life were detailed in the clinical surroundings of a coroner’s court in a short hearing on Monday attended by Jamal, who had come to learn what more he could of how a loved brother from his east African homeland came to be lying broken and in a pool of blood on the asphalt of an Second World War RAF bomber base in East Anglia.

The inquest heard that as the Volvo coach was being manoeuvred by Mr Evans, Ahmed most probably fell beneath the double rear wheels, suffering the awful head injuries which killed him instantly. The impact left bruising the pattern of the coach’s tyres on the teenager’s body.

In Calais, where some 2,300 migrants from the world’s war zones are gathered at any one time hoping to smuggle, bribe or even sail their way across the Channel, the deaths of refugees falling from lorries or being struck on motorways has become a grimly regular occurrence.

The Independent has been told of at least 15 fatalities among migrants in the last year, many of them Eritreans and Ethiopians, as they take ever-increasing risks to secure a passage to a new life. The youngest was 16.

Deaths on this side of the Straits of Dover remain rare and, in the case of Ahmed, all the more despairing for the loss of a life so close to the end of a treacherous journey from as Eritrea, where years of war and a vicious authoritarian regime have caused hundreds of thousands to flee.

The United Nations last month reported a tripling to nearly 37,000 in the number of Eritreans entering Europe in the first 10 months of 2014.

Most, like Ahmed, will have paid traffickers some $3,000 (£1,900) for the journey across Africa and the journey, all too often in a leaking boat, across the Mediterranean to Italy, ending in the makeshift camps and squats of Calais from where seek to reach the questionable El Dorado of Britain.

It was a journey which Jamal, 20, made four years ago before successfully arriving in London and being granted asylum. When he received a message that his younger brother was also on his way across the Channel but heard nothing from him, he travelled to France, this time bearing a British passport, to find Ahmed.

The phonecall from Norfolk Police asking him to return home to identify the body of his brother came as he stood in a coach park in Boulogne, one of two places along with the Cité Europe shopping centre in Calais, where Ahmed probably smuggled himself onto the coach.

At Kings Lynn County Court, police investigators said no blame could be attached to the coach driver, Mr Evans.

PC Forbes Scott, a forensic accident investigator, said the void occupied by Ahmed was so narrow he himself could not physically enter it and Mr Evans could not have known of the stowaway’s presence or seen him as he manoeuvred his vehicle. Checks on the vehicle at Calais by British border officials had also failed to find any sign of Ahmed hidden in the bowels of the coach.

Senior Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, said what had happened was the “very tragic death of a very young man”.

His brother, a softly spoken man, was too upset to talk after the proceedings but his questions to PC Scott during the hearing told the story of the grief he and his family have endured: “why did Ahmed wait until the last moment to come out?”, “if he had shouted, could he have been heard by the driver?”, and “did he lose his life immediately?”.

The answers, such as the available evidence could show, were “we don’t know”, “no”, and “yes, immediately”.

Jamal left the court building holding a police evidence bag containing the entirety of his brother’s worldly goods - a €50 note, his mobile phone and the buckle from his belt.

An Eritrean friend, who declined to be named, said: “We all come here for the same purpose - to leave behind a terrible war, a terrible place for somewhere safe where we can live with peace and respect. That is all we seek and, as you can see, we will take any risk to achieve it.”"

Among them was Meet Singh Kapoor, a 40-year-old who died during the overnight crossing from Zeebrugge in Belgium.

Basildon Crown Court was told the refugees, believed to have fled Kabul in Afghanistan after allegedly suffering persecution and living illegally in Belgium and France, were the “human cargo” of a “sophisticated international organisation” of people smugglers.

Northern Irish lorry drivers Stephen McLaughlin, 36, and Martin McGlinchey, 49, are accused of being in the gang’s “inner circle” and face charges of helping to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK.

Jurors were told the two men were part of a team responsible for arranging the transport logistics of the operation, allegedly organising for the container to be sent from Dover to France so it could be picked up by an innocent man before being loaded with illegal immigrants on a Belgian industrial estate.

Prosecuting, Michael Goodwin told the court the plan was foiled when port workers in Tilbury heard the screams of those in the container.

After the operation was sprung, he said, McLaughlin, from Limavady, Londonderry, and McGlinchey, of Coalisland, Co Tyrone, frantically tried to cover their tracks, destroying mobile phones and sim cards that might implicate them."

The men fled Cuba in August. Good Samaritans found two of their bodies in the water off Hollywood Beach on Aug. 24. The Coast Guard later discovered two more.

Mediterranean,2014-08-24,24.0,,24,364.0,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Drowning,Libya,Central Mediterranean,Unspecified location between North Africa and Italy.,http://www.unhcr.org/53fc58969.html,4,"GENEVA, August 26 (UNHCR) - More than 300 people have died while trying to make irregular sea crossings from North Africa to Europe in the past week, bringing the death toll this year from sinking vesels on the Mediterranean to almost 1,900, including some 1,600 since June.

""The past few days have been the deadliest this year on the Mediterranean for people making irregular crossings to Europe, with at least three vessels having overturned or sunk,"" UNHCR's senior spokesperson, Melissa Fleming, told journalists in Geneva.

She said the first and largest of these incidents occurred last Friday when a boat, reportedly carrying at least 270 people, capsized near Garibouli to the east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Nineteen people survived, but the Libyan coastguard has recovered the bodies of 100 others, including five young children and seven women. The remaining 251 passengers are feared drowned.

Citing reports from survivors, Fleming said ""the boat was packed full and more people were pushed on board before they departed. According to the accounts, the boat suddenly flipped, trapping the people on the lower deck."" The Libyan coastguard has asked for help in the search and rescue operation and to recover bodies.

In a second incident on Saturday evening, the Italian Navy rescued 73 people and recovered 18 bodies from a damaged rubber dinghy 20 miles from Libyan territorial waters. UNHCR's Fleming said 10 people were still missing and feared drowned.

The passengers were mainly from Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Sudan. The dinghy was already partially deflated when spotted by an Italian search and rescue aircraft and life rafts were dropped to people struggling in the water.

In a third incident, on Sunday evening, a fishing boat carrying about 400 people capsized north of the Libyan coast in bad weather. The Italian Navy and coastguard, in a joint operation with a nearby merchant ship, rescued 364 people. So far, 24 bodies have been recovered and more are feared dead. The exact number of missing is not yet confirmed.

The main departure country for Europe is Libya, where the worsening security situation has fostered the growth of people smuggling operations, but also encouraged refugees and migrants to risk the sea journey rather than remain in a conflict zone.

""UNHCR's Tripoli office receives daily calls from refugees, asylum-seekers and other vulnerable people expressing fear for their lives and making desperate requests for food, water, medicine and relocation. Those who choose to leave for Italy are taking longer and riskier journeys through new ports of departure such as Benghazi [in eastern Libya],"" Fleming said.

She noted that many of those risking their lives at sea to reach Europe were refugees fleeing conflict, violence and persecution. ""This dramatic situation at Europe's sea borders demands urgent and concerted European action, including strengthened search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean, ensuring that rescue measures are safe and incur minimum risks for those being rescued,"" she added.

""UNHCR commends the life-saving Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) operation the Italian Navy and coastguard is conducting that has saved thousands of lives. As more refugees and migrants risk their lives at sea to reach Europe, mostly Eritreans, Syrians, and Somalis, urgent action is needed,"" Fleming stressed.

The UN refugee agency believes that it is of vital importance that survivors of these tragedies, who often have lost family and friends, be given immediate access to psychological support once they are disembarked. UNHCR has also called for procedures to be put in place to allow for identification of the bodies recovered at sea, providing quick and clear information so that families are not subjected to unnecessary additional suffering."

""I'm happy I made it, alive, but it was something no-one should have to go through,"" said Alain Izquierdo, a Havana butcher, and one of 15 survivors of the 32 passengers. Six passengers are missing after they tried to swim to shore, while 11 others died of dehydration. ""I just feel sad for those who didn't make it,"" said Izquierdo, sitting under a sun shade by the pool of his uncle and aunt's home in Port St Lucie, on Florida's east coast. The survivors were rescued by Mexican fishermen 150 miles (240 km) northeast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and were briefly detained in Mexico before being released late last month. Their story is one of the most tragic Cuban migrant disasters in decades. Reuters spoke to several of the passengers and their relatives in Florida and Texas, although some were still too traumatized to talk publicly about the experience. Cubans seeking to flee the communist-run island are heading in increasing numbers by sea to Central America and then making a long journey overland to reach the United States. Under Washington's ""wet foot, dry foot policy,"" Cuban migrants who make it onto U.S. soil are allowed to remain, while those intercepted at sea are turned back. The group set off from eastern Cuba in early August, but ran into trouble about 40 miles from the Cayman Islands when the boat's motor - a Hyundai diesel car engine, attached to a homemade propeller - failed on the second day at sea, said Izquierdo, 32. The 20-foot, home-made craft, made from aluminum roofing sheets riveted together and sealed with cloth and resin, drifted up the Cuban coast as the passengers tried to flag down passing ships. ""No-one stopped even though they could see we were desperate,"" said Mailin Perez, 30, another survivor recovering in Austin, Texas. The passengers heaved the engine overboard to reduce weight and fashioned a makeshift sail from sheets sewn together with cord. Six of the men decided to swim for the Cuban coast clinging to inner tubes, but have not been heard from since. Brief rain showers every three or four days provided the only water, rationed out in doses by medical syringes. One woman who was six months pregnant received extra rations. One by one, 11 passengers died. Their bodies, lips swollen, were slid overboard, and floated off into the distance, a sight that one survivor said haunts her in nightmares. The first to die was Izquierdo's friend, 50-year-old Havana car mechanic, Rafael Baratuti O'Farrill. ""That was the saddest day,"" said Izquierdo. After running out of water, some passengers began drinking sea water, as well as their own urine. O'Farrill was one of several who also used syringes to draw their own blood to drink. ""That was a mistake, the ones who drank their blood became faint. Gradually they lost their minds and faded away,"" said Izquierdo. MORE MIGRANTS O'Farrill and Izquierdo had quit their jobs in Havana six months earlier after hearing that boats were leaving for Central America from the port town of Manzanillo, in eastern Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard had virtually shut down the shorter routes across the treacherous Florida Straits, which separates Cuba and Florida by only 90 miles at its narrowest point. After Honduras' leftist president Manuel Zelaya, an ally of Cuba, was toppled in 2009 and replaced by a conservative, the longer western route became popular, a trip of about 675 miles, via the Cayman Islands. Honduran authorities give Cuban migrants temporary visas allowing them to head north for the United States. Most boats withstand the journey, taking a week to 10 days to cross the sea, said Izquierdo, who paid $500 to join the ill-fated voyage. ""Boats are leaving Manzanillo every week and most of them make it,"" said Izquierdo. U.S. authorities said last month more than 16,200 Cubans arrived without visas at the border with Mexico in the past 11 months, the highest number in a decade. Cuban officials have not commented on the illegal boat departures, but blame the U.S. policy for encouraging migrants to risk their lives. Izquierdo and Perez said they abandoned Cuba for economic reasons to find a better future for their children. Izquierdo left behind his wife and two small boys in Havana. Perez was reunited with her husband in Texas, but also has a young son and daughter in Cuba. Economic reforms underway to modernize the Cuban economy by allowing greater private sector activity have so far failed to improve living standards, they said. Instead, conditions were getting worse. ""The pressure cooker is boiling, it's ready to burst,"" said Izquierdo. Both sought to leave legally, but were told it could take five years before their cases would be determined by U.S. consular officials. Thinking of their spouses and children is what kept them alive, said Izquierdo and Perez. ""I knew I had to be strong for them,"" said Perez. ""I felt very weak at the end. I was scared to close my eyes in case I never woke up."" (Reporting By David Adams; Editing by Kieran Murray and Andre Grenon)

BEN GUERDANE, August 31- Tunisian coastguards on Sunday resumed the search for more bodies of drowned migrants, thought to be mainly Syrians, after finding a 42nd shipwreck victim, officials said.

“Forty two bodies have been recovered: 31 were buried on the spot and 11 others will be during the day,” said Tahar Souid, coordinator of the emergency centre set up at Ben Guerdane in southeast Tunisia where the first bodies were discovered on Friday.

By Saturday evening when the search was called off for the night, the body count from the sinking, thought to have happened off the Libyan coast, had reached 41.

Rescuers “have found Syrian identity papers”, Souid said, in the first indication of the victims’ nationality.

Many of the bodies, some still with life jackets on, have washed up on the Tunisian shore.

However, operations were complicated on Sunday by a strong wind from the southwest blowing the remaining bodies offshore and fisherman reported finding more bodies in the sea, he said.

The victims were found in an area that has seen many boatloads of illegal migrants capsize.

The director of El Ketf port, Fethi Abaab, said on Saturday that women were among the cadavers.

A rescue operations official said the bodies were badly decomposed and added that he believed they were migrants who had been trying to make their way to Europe in search of a better life.

They were “probably” some of the people who went missing earlier this week when a boat capsized after leaving the Libyan port of Zwara, heading for Italy, the official said.

Mired in unrest and political chaos, Libya has been a launchpad for illegal migrants trying to reach Europe and who turn to people smugglers to cross the Mediterranean, mainly to Italy.

Last week, Libyan rescuers recovered the bodies of around 170 people after a vessel carrying illegal immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa sank, the coastguard said.

The International Organisation for Migration has warned that unrest in Libya could lead more migrants to risk their lives and take to unseaworthy boats to try to reach Italy.

The UN’s refugee agency the UNHCR says more than 100,000 people have made it to Italy by sea since the start of the year.

Navi italiane e maltesi sono impegnate nelle operazioni di ricerca di oltre 20 migranti che si teme possano essere morti dopo che la barca su cui viaggiavano è affondata a circa 300 miglia a sudest di Malta. I sopravvissuti in un primo momento avevano parlato ai soccorritori di circa 400 morti, ma secondo una ricostruzione ancora da verificare, le persone a bordo dovrebbero essere state circa una trentina. I naufraghi hanno poi riferito che l’imbarcazione sulla quale viaggiavano era stata colpita da un’altra barca. Attualmente i morti sarebbero due e 12 persone sono state salvate (fra cui due bambini), ma è destinato ad aggravarsi dal momento che sono già stati avvistati altri cadaveri. I dispersi risultano al momento 16 e nelle ricerche sono impegnate forze maltesi e italiane. L’operazione è iniziata ieri dopo che un mercantile ha recuperato due bambini, che hanno riferito che con loro a bordo c’erano 30 persone. Chi si è salvato è stato portato in Grecia , la zona più rapida da raggiungere in elicottero.

L’operazione di salvataggio è scattata quando, durante un normale pattugliamento aereo, un velivolo della Guardia Costiera maltese aveva avvistato alcune persone in acqua. Sul posto sono stati dirottati alcuni mercantili, che sono riusciti a portare in salvo sette persone ancora in vita. Oggi, intanto, a Malta sono attesi l’alto commissario Onu per i rifugiati Antonio Guterres e l’ambasciatrice dell’Unhcr Angelina Jolie.

“Ritengo che Mare Nostrum sia stata l’unica azione che ci abbia riportato alla realtà, molto meritoria perché ha salvato migliaia di vite umane ma evidentemente da sola non basta” dice la presidente della Camera Laura Boldrini, a margine della sua visita al carcere minorile Malaspina di Palermo. “Salvare vite umane in mare è un imperativo etico e va fatto – ha aggiunto – dopo di che bisogna dare ai richiedenti asilo un’alternativa ad imbarcarsi, un’alternativa prima di prendere i gommoni e rischiare la vita in mare. Ed è qui che la Comunità internazionale e l’Unione europea dovrebbe fare di più”. Boldrini sottolinea la necessità di “un accordo a livello europeo affinché si possa fare uno screening dei richiedenti asilo nei paesi di transito con l’impegno poi dei paesi europei a prendersi una quota delle persone che sono state riconosciute bisognose di protezione. È un programma che esiste ci sono paesi che lo fanno ma l’Unione europea non brilla per disponibilità. S pesso gli altri paesi europei ci criticano perché dicono l’Italia fa molto per salvare vite umane ma poi non fa abbastanza per accogliere queste persone che poi arrivano da noi. Io credo che sia necessario attivare sinergie per fare in modo che tutti facciano la loro parte”.

Intanto sono attesi a Crotone altri 956 migranti di diverse nazionalità, scortati dalla nave “Euro” della marina militare, mentre 478 profughi sono attesi a Porto Empedocle, Agrigento, dopo esser stati soccorsi nel canale di Sicilia nell’ambito dell’operazione Mare Nostrum. Ieri, 421 persone sono arrivate al porto di Palermo. A queste vanno aggiunte, inoltre, i 721 che hanno trovato accoglienza a Trapanio. Le prefetture si stanno organizzando, insieme alle istituzioni locali e alle forze dell’ordine, per gestire il massiccio afflusso di immigrati e garantire, comunque, l’ordine pubblico."
Western Asia,2014-09-24,1.0,,1,,,1.0,1.0,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Violence,Syrian Arab Republic,Syria to Türkiye,"Syria - Turkey border, at Kobani Tel Shair",https://bit.ly/1LvKoIA,4,"(Istanbul) – Landmines placed decades ago by the Turkish military have killed at least three civilians trying to flee Syria and injured at least nine others, Human Rights Watch said today. The landmines, in a restricted zone along the border with Syria, threaten thousands more Syrian refugees.

To prevent further casualties and protect civilians, Turkey should undertake immediate efforts to safely relocate over 2,000 Syrian refugees remaining in the minefield and educate the refugees about the risk posed by the landmines, Human Rights Watch said. Turkey should clear all mined areas on its territory, starting with areas of its border with Syria where refugees may cross and mine clearance personnel can operate safely.

“To fall victim to a landmine after losing your home and fleeing your country is a fate no one should have to endure,” said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch and chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a 1997 Nobel Peace Laureate. “Turkey has the capacity to clear its minefields and should clear them immediately.”

Fighting began around the Syrian border town of Kobani (or Ain al-`Arab in Arabic) between Kurdish forces and the extremist militant group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in September 2014. Since then, thousands of Syrians have fled across the border into Turkey through a narrow strip of mined land just inside Turkey northwest and northeast of Kobani.

Satellite imagery recorded as far back as 1968 shows this strip of land is part of an extensive belt of minefields that the Turkish military laid along its border with Syria in the 1950s. Turkey reported that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border “to prevent illegal border crossings.”

The majority of the civilians fleeing Kobani have crossed into Turkey and been accommodated in nearby refugee camps. However, according to humanitarian workers, and apparent in recent satellite imagery, over 2,000 civilians remained as of November 18 in a section of the mine belt referred to as the Tel Shair corridor northwest of Kobani where they are at risk from landmines. They remain in the mine belt just inside Turkey because Turkey was refusing entry for cars or livestock and they did not want to leave behind their belongings. Human Rights Watch has also found evidence in satellite imagery recorded on November 14 that potentially hundreds more Syrian refugees remain in the mine belt near the Turkish villages of Mertismail and Çanakcı, less than 9 kilometers east of Kobani.

Turkey joined the Mine Ban Treaty in 2003, and as a state party had the legal obligation to perimeter-mark, monitor, and fence all mined areas as soon as possible “to ensure the effective exclusion of civilians.” It also had an initial treaty deadline of March 2014 to clear all mines, but received an extension until March 2022.

“Like other mine-contaminated areas, border minefields are not safe for civilians and should be cleared immediately to avoid further harm,” Goose said.

The Landmine Incidents

All of the incidents documented by Human Rights Watch occurred within the Tel Shair corridor, which runs along the Turkish side of the border immediately northwest of Kobani. Measuring between 300 and 400 meters in width, the corridor extends to the east, following a disused railway that physically marks the border between Turkey and Syria. To the north, the corridor is bounded by a barbed-wire fence that restricts further movement into Turkey.

The Tel Shair corridor area had at least 70 mine explosions between September 15 and November 15, according to humanitarian workers who spoke to Human Rights Watch. They also told Human Rights Watch that civilians died or were injured in at least six of these explosions, including one 10-year-old boy who was killed and seven other children who were wounded. In the other incidents, the mines were detonated by livestock, they said.

On November 7, a humanitarian worker told Human Rights Watch that a landmine explodes in Tel Shair every two to three days, caused by fleeing civilians or their livestock. He said refugees fleeing through the area have brought at least six undetonated landmines that they have cleared themselves to Turkish soldiers.

The injuries and deaths occurred when the victims were on foot, indicating that they stepped on antipersonnel mines. Some cars passing through the mined corridor have also been damaged, but no injuries have been reported as a result.

Human Rights Watch analyzed a detailed time series of satellite images recorded along the border, and identified a total of five large concentrations of civilians within the minefield belt to the northwest and northeast of Kobani. The satellite imagery confirms the presence of thousands of vehicles, as well as livestock, in the minefield as of November 13, the last available image date.

Two humanitarian workers in Turkey at the border told Human Rights Watch that many civilians fleeing the conflict in September and October crossed the border near Kobani with their cars and livestock, and remained within the Tel Shair corridor because Turkey was refusing entry for cars or livestock and the civilians did not want to leave their belongings. Some of the animals – cows and sheep – entered the unmarked minefields and detonated mines, they said, based on conversations with refugees who had crossed into Turkey.

Photographs provided to Human Rights Watch by humanitarian workers show what appears to be a US M2 bounding antipersonnel mine that was allegedly removed from the Turkish minefields north of Kobani. According to Turkey’s annual transparency reports, which are required by Article 7 of the Mine Ban Treaty, Turkey had in the past stockpiled large quantities of the M2.

Human Rights Watch has also identified clear evidence from the satellite imagery that the largest civilian concentration in the Tel Shair corridor was hit by multiple mortar shells between November 7 and 9, and again between November 9 and 13.

One of the humanitarian aid workers at the border told Human Rights Watch by phone that on November 8 at around 8 a.m., ISIS fighters launched approximately five mortars on the area where civilians were gathered. An activist in Kobani who spoke to Human Rights Watch also visited the border and confirmed the November 8 attack. The attack killed at least three people, including one child, and injured at least 15 others, they said.

A Landmine Victim’s Account

Human Rights Watch interviewed one Syrian Kurdish woman who stepped on a mine after she entered Turkey, badly wounding herself and her 7-year-old daughter. She said she did not see any signs warning that there were landmines in the area.

The woman, “Selma,” 35, a farmer and mother of six from the village of Zakariah, approximately 35 kilometers west of Kobani/Ayn al-Arab, said that she and her family fled their village after ISIS fighters attacked the area on September 16 and 17. The family escaped to the hills in the east, where they remained for three days until learning that ISIS forces had destroyed their homes, she said. After that, the family went to Kobani and joined a large number of people who were moving toward the Turkish border.

Selma said her family left their car and walked toward the border. They passed over the railway track into the Tel Shair corridor and were approaching the outter perimeter fence when she stepped on a landmine:

I was carrying my 1-year-old son, while my 7-year-old daughter was holding onto my dress. I stepped on a landmine and it exploded. My son fell to the ground, while my daughter suffered first degree burns on her face.

Selma estimated that after about 15 minutes four humanitarian workers came to assist her. They wrapped her leg in a bandage and carried her to a taxi bound for the State Hospital in Suruç, Turkey, a 30 minute drive away. At the hospital, doctors amputated her left leg, she told Human Rights Watch.

The Recent Landmine Deaths and Injuries

The following are the six incidents in which refugees were injured or killed by landmines while crossing in the west Kobani Tel Shair corridor, based on records reviewed by Human Rights Watch, including photos collected from humanitarian workers. All victims were on foot.

On September 19 or 20, “Selma,” 35, and her daughter, 7, were injured in the border minefield;

On September 21, two brothers, ages 10 and 11, were wounded in the border minefield;

On September 24, a 10-year-old boy from the village of Khanik was killed in the border minefield. Two boys from the same village, ages 12 and 13, were wounded, with severe facial injuries;

On September 24, two males between 15 and 20 years old were killed in the border minefield – both decapitated in the explosion;

On September 24, a male between the ages of 15 and 20 from the town of Shiran was severely wounded in a mine explosion in the border corridor; and

On September 24, a 5-year-old girl from Meedan Village and her 6-year-old brother were injured in the border minefield.

Humanitarian workers told Human Rights Watch an additional nine people were injured in these six explosions but did not provide any details about the victims, and Human Rights Watch could not independently confirm the additional injuries.

Turkey’s Landmine History; Syria’s Landmine Use

Turkey acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty in September 2003, becoming a State Party on March 1, 2004. A former landmine producer, Turkey is not known to have exported antipersonnel mines, but it imported the weapons from Germany and the United States.

In June 2011, Turkey completed the destruction of its 2.9 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines, long after its treaty-mandated deadline of March 1, 2008. It has been criticized for retaining a high number of antipersonnel mines – more than 15,000 – for the purpose of training in mine detection, clearance, and destruction techniques.

Under the Mine Ban Treaty, Turkey is required to destroy all antipersonnel mines in mined areas under its jurisdiction or control as soon as possible. In December 2013, Mine Ban Treaty states granted Turkey an extension of its mine clearance deadline until March 1, 2022 after Turkey acknowledged it would fail to meet the original deadline of March 1, 2014.

According to Landmine Monitor, a civil society based initiative that documents the humanitarian and developmental consequences of landmine use and the implementation of the treaty that bans antipersonnel mines, a 2009 Turkish law approved demining of minefields along the country’s 911 kilometer border with Syria and gave Turkey’s National Defense Ministry the lead role and responsibility for the demining process. In July 2013, the ministry cancelled demining tenders for clearing the border because of developments in Syria. It has provided no further information on its clearance plans for the southern border with Syria. Human Rights Watch has participated in the Landmine Monitor since its inception in 1999.

Human Rights Watch has previously documented the Syrian government’s use of landmines on its border in other areas. There were numerous media reports of new Syrian government mine-laying on the country’s borders with Lebanon and Turkey in late 2011 and early 2012. A Syrian government official told the Associated Press in November 2011 that “Syria has undertaken many measures to control the borders, including planting mines.” In March 2012, Human Rights Watch reported the use of Soviet/Russian-origin PMN-2 antipersonnel mines and TMN-46 antivehicle mines by Syrian forces in border areas near Turkey. Syria has not joined the Mine Ban Treaty.

The Mine Ban Treaty comprehensively prohibits antipersonnel mines and requires the clearance of all mined areas on territory under the jurisdiction or control within 10 years. A total of 162 countries have joined the Mine Ban Treaty, including Iraq and Jordan, but not Israel or Lebanon."
Western Asia,2014-09-24,2.0,,2,,,2.0,1.0,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Violence,Syrian Arab Republic,Syria to Türkiye,"Syria - Turkey border, at Kobani Tel Shair",https://bit.ly/1LvKoIA,4,"(Istanbul) – Landmines placed decades ago by the Turkish military have killed at least three civilians trying to flee Syria and injured at least nine others, Human Rights Watch said today. The landmines, in a restricted zone along the border with Syria, threaten thousands more Syrian refugees.

To prevent further casualties and protect civilians, Turkey should undertake immediate efforts to safely relocate over 2,000 Syrian refugees remaining in the minefield and educate the refugees about the risk posed by the landmines, Human Rights Watch said. Turkey should clear all mined areas on its territory, starting with areas of its border with Syria where refugees may cross and mine clearance personnel can operate safely.

“To fall victim to a landmine after losing your home and fleeing your country is a fate no one should have to endure,” said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch and chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a 1997 Nobel Peace Laureate. “Turkey has the capacity to clear its minefields and should clear them immediately.”

Fighting began around the Syrian border town of Kobani (or Ain al-`Arab in Arabic) between Kurdish forces and the extremist militant group Islamic State (also known as ISIS) in September 2014. Since then, thousands of Syrians have fled across the border into Turkey through a narrow strip of mined land just inside Turkey northwest and northeast of Kobani.

Satellite imagery recorded as far back as 1968 shows this strip of land is part of an extensive belt of minefields that the Turkish military laid along its border with Syria in the 1950s. Turkey reported that between 1957 and 1998, Turkish forces laid 615,419 antipersonnel mines along the Syrian border “to prevent illegal border crossings.”

The majority of the civilians fleeing Kobani have crossed into Turkey and been accommodated in nearby refugee camps.

Eastern Africa,2014-10-02,64.0,,64,,,,,Unknown,Eastern Africa,Drowning,Somalia,Eastern Route to/from EHOA,Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia - EHOA-Yemen crossing,http://www.unhcr.org/5440ff676.html,4,"There's been a sharp increase this year in the number of migrants and asylum seekers losing their lives in attempts to get to Yemen, mainly from the Horn of Africa, with more deaths in 2014 than in the last three years combined

In the latest tragic incident on Oct 2, 64 migrants and three crew died when their vessel, sailing from Somalia, sank in the Gulf of Aden. With five additional deaths since, this brings the number of dead this year to 215, exceeding the combined total for 2011, 2012 and 2013. It's also the largest single loss of life since sinkings in June, when 62 people died; March, when 44 people lost their lives; and another in April, with 12 people dead.

There have been frequent reports of mistreatment, abuse, rape and torture and the increasingly cruel measures being adopted by smuggling rings seem to account for the increase in deaths at sea. Boats crossing to Yemen are overcrowded, and smugglers have reportedly thrown passengers overboard to prevent capsizing or avoid detection. Search-and-rescue officials say the practice has resulted in hundreds of undocumented casualties in recent years

The latest deaths come against the background of a dramatic increase in the number of new arrivals for September off Yemen's coast. At 12,768, it marks the single biggest month for arrivals since current records began to be kept in 2002.

The reasons for the surge are believed to include ongoing drought in South-Central Somalia, as well as the combined effects of conflict, insecurity, and lack of livelihood opportunities in countries of origin. Moreover, the surge can also be attributed to a decreasing level of cooperation between the countries in the region to better manage migratory movements.

UNHCR and its partners provide initial reception and assistance to individuals arriving across the Yemeni coast at the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden as well as record all reported incidents. UNHCR and the Society for Humanitarian Solidary provide first aid, and food assistance at 3 coastal transit centers to those identified, usually in a dire situation, by the patrolling teams upon their arrival at the coast.

Transportation services are then provided from the transit centers to the nearest reception center for initial registration by the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) on behalf of UNHCR. With Somalis receiving prima facie refugee status from the Government of Yemen, non-Somalis who express interest in seeking asylum are provided with attestation letters to present at the UNHCR offices in Sana'a or Aden and begin the Refugee Status Determination process.

Despite the commitment and the continuing work of the Yemeni Government and others on this issue, it is clear that these ongoing efforts alone cannot hope to avoid such loss of life.

UNHCR has continued to offer support to the Government of Yemen in strengthening its capacity for search and rescue at sea, safe embarkation and proper identification, as well as initial reception and referral mechanisms for vulnerable people in need of protection and assistance.

We also call on countries of origin, transit and destination in the region to step up their cooperation in managing the flows of migration. At the same time they must pay due attention to the protection needs of refugees, asylum seekers and other vulnerable groups such as women and minors. This kind of regional cooperation was the central idea behind a Regional Conference on Asylum and Migration organized by the Government of Yemen with support from UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration in November 2013 and it lies at the heart of the Sana'a Declaration adopted by the Conference.

Yemen is the only country in the Arabian Peninsula that is signatory to the 1951 refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. It currently hosts 246,000 refugees of whom over 230,000 Somali and a smaller portion of Ethiopian, Eritrean, Iraqi and Syrian refugees. The majority of the refugees have been living in Yemen for many years. Yemen also hosts more than 334,000 Internally Displaced Persons, either forced from their homes as a result of recent conflicts or living in long-term displacement.

Between 80 and 90 people were rescued after the boat went down in waters east of Tripoli. AA Photo

At least 10 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa drowned Oct. 2 and dozens more were missing after their boat sank in the Mediterranean offshore Libya, the coast guard said.Between 80 and 90 people were rescued after the boat went down in waters east of Tripoli, a coast guard officer said, adding that survivors said there had been up to 180 people on board.Among those saved were two women, according to the officer, who said the boat capsized three nautical miles off Guarabouli, which is 60 kilometres (36 miles) from the capital.Thursday's tragedy was the second this week involving Africans trying to make their way to a new life in Europe and comes a year after 360 people perished in a sinking, burning ship off the Italian island of Lampedusa.On Wednesday, Spanish coastguards pulled the bodies of two Africans from the sea off Morocco and six others were missing after a dinghy carrying them sank.For years, Libya has been a major embarkation point for hundreds of thousands of refugees, mostly Africans, heading for Europe.They risk their lives on often unseaworthy craft trying to make it to Malta or to Lampedusa, south of Sicily, and hundreds are lost each year.By far the worst tragedy took place last month, when about 500 people drowned off Malta after traffickers rammed and sank their boat after they refused to transfer to a smaller vessel.The implosion of Libya, civil war in Syria and renewed Israeli-Palestinian hostilities have helped push the flow of would-be refugees seeking sanctuary in Europe to unprecedented levels.More than 3,000 migrants have died trying to cross the Mediterranean so far this year, more than double the previous peak in 2011, the International Organisation for Migration said Monday."

Europe,2014-07-10,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Drowning,Norway,English Channel to the UK,"Body recovered near Lisa, Norway on 02.01.2015",https://bit.ly/2LI6ELU,3,"Neither the DNA profile from the body in the Netherlands or Norway produced any hits internationally through Interpol. All leads in the case trail off in front of the cash register in Decathlon in Calais, barely an hour after sunset on October 7 last year.

The total for the goods was 256 euros. The customer paid cash. There is no surveillance footage from the shop.

When the serial number on the wetsuit was sent to Norway, it became clear where the other one had ended up. It was found by an architect during a winter storm in Lista, 850 kilometres from Calais, 87 days after it was purchased.

But there was more: There was two of everything on the receipt. Welzenbagh knew full well where one of the wetsuits was – in the evidence store in the Netherlands.

At 20.03 pm , Tuesday, October 7, 2014, a customer stood in front of the cash register of the Decathlon sports shop in the French port city of Calais by The English Channel. The customer bought a Triboard Subsea 5mm wetsuit, medium size, for 79 Euros. The customer also bought hand paddles – plates swimmers use on their hands to provide more resistance when they train, a snorkel and a diving mask, flippers, water socks – usually used for gymnastics in water and a waterproof A4 plastic folder.

John Welzenbagh knew this. When he discovered the little RFID-symbol on the tightly sewn tag with the wetsuit’s serial number and goods declaration, he knew he could find out where and when the suit was sold. And – if there was a credit card number on the receipt – who bought it. Here’s what he found out:

RFID stands for “Radio-Frequency Identification” and are tiny data chips that are used for everything from registering passengers in toll stations to identifying pets. They are also used in all sorts of goods, as a modern barcode system that stores information about where goods are moving from the time they are produced until they are scanned at a cash register and disappear into a shopping bag.

The wetsuit was the only strong clue Welzenbagh had to work with. A 5 millimetre thick neoprene wetsuit with a hood, made for diving and snorkelling in temperatures between 16 and 24 degrees. In the North Sea and The English Channel, water temperatures rarely rise above 15. At the end of October when the body was found, the normal temperature is an icy 10 degrees.

The police were back at square one. Fingerprints were impossible to reproduce. There were no papers or other characteristics and the DNA profile and missing report they sent out through Interpol met with no response.

“We had no way of knowing what kind of water sports he had been doing. If we called him the diver, I was afraid we would overlook clues that could help us. I said 'from now on, we will call him the wetsuitman'.”

“This was of course wrong, but even at our meetings he was known as the diver. I didn’t like that,” says Welzenbagh.

When the wetsuitman was found, four windsurfers were reported missing in England. The main theory in the first days was that one of them had floated ashore. The windsurfers had however already been found. The same went for a French diver who went missing outside Normandy. Still, Dutch media reported that the body found on Texel was a diver from France.

“I thought he might be from Spain. There are not many other places in Europe where you see that hair colour, in any case, not amongst ethnic Europeans,” he says.

There were not many physical characteristics to go on. The only thing Welzenbagh noticed was that the body had very dark hair.

How long had the wetsuitman been lying in the water? Three days? Three weeks? The rate of decay is difficult to assess when a person is in a wetsuit in cold water. Where did he come from? It was also impossible to say. Welzenbagh has found dead people from the entire North Sea and the Channel area: England, Scotland, France, Germany, Belgium and of course the Netherlands.

Every year Welzenbagh and the Dutch North Sea group get in between 20 and 30 bodies or remains for identification. Most turn out to have gone missing from the local area. Most of the cases are solved quickly.

The wetsuitman was found on Texel early in the morning on October 27 last year. He was wearing a black and grey wetsuit, identical to the wetsuit found with human remains inside at Lista 67 days later. The body was found along the water’s edge on the broad beach below the dunes and cafes in the small village of De Koog. It is a beach that is popular among windsurfers and tourists from all over the Netherlands come here in the summer.

Just a few weeks ago, he had a breakthrough in another case and is close to identifying an older, probably French, woman who floated ashore here 15 years ago.

On the ferry across from Den Helder to the island of Texel a couple of hours north of Amsterdam, Welzenbagh points to a sand bank and explains that he is still looking into the identity of a man who was found on a sailboat there in 1995.

Welzenbagh is a 52 years old former navy diver, he is fit and wears a dark windbreaker jacket and sports sunglasses. He is the kind of investigator who lies awake at night, pondering unsolved cases.

“We call him the wetsuitman,” says John Welzenbagh, investigator at the Netherlands special police unit for persons missing in the North Sea.

The Lista body is not the only one that drifted ashore in a grey and black Triboard wetsuit.

On February 5, Kripos sent out a so called “Black Notice” through Interpol. It contains a DNA profile and a detailed description of the finding of the body on Lista. They received an answer the next day.

No missing reports in Norway match the body found at Lista. In the wetsuit case, only DNA has been found. If Kripos is to be able to identify the body, he must for some reason have a registered DNA profile somewhere in the world or a family member must have reported him missing and provided a DNA test.

Post-mortem information is compared with information from missing reports, where family or friends have provided details about people they are looking for. The main requirements for identification are information on teeth, fingerprints and DNA. One requirement is not enough to establish identity and has to be supported by one or several additional required pieces of information. There may be findings on the body, medical information or tactical information connecting the body to a missing person.

When Kripos receives an unidentified body, forensic experts, pathologists, dentists and forensic geneticists collect so called post-mortem information. They create a DNA profile, take fingerprints and register information about teeth, any jewellery, previous bone fractures, tattoos and any other characteristics that may help in the identification of a body. They also try to establish the cause of death.

“The man in the wetsuit could be number 17. This is a special case,” says Angel.

The list of missing people in Norway since 1947 amounts to 1,443 people at the time of writing. The list of dead people found in the same time period, but who the police have not managed to identify, is considerably shorter. Just 16 bodies, including several findings of bones which most likely originate in pre-modern times.

Police Superintendent Per Angel has been identifying dead bodies since the end of the 80s. He is head of the Kripos national ID group. They are called in cases of simultaneous multiple deaths or when an unidentified body is found. Angel talks about Norway being a country made for accidents. We have a lot of storms, rugged landscape, and thousands of workplaces offshore and in the Polar region. We have had train accidents, plane crashes, shipwrecks and terrorism.

“When we have so little to go on, we have to turn to DNA profiling to find the answer. And we can’t get that kind of thing done here,” he says.

In this case, there was not a lot Unnhammer could do.

There is a sea chart of the Lista area on the office wall. The currents in the sea are very unpredictable and ever changing. Not even professional fishermen can tell how the ocean will behave the next day. It is impossible to say where a corpse that floats ashore here has come from.

“From time to time, we get bodies floating in here, but we haven’t had one that we haven’t managed to identify before,” says Unnhammer.

They checked the body against a missing report from the Stavanger area, where a man in a wetsuit had gone missing a couple of years ago. Neither that body nor anybody else who had been reported missing matched the body found at Lista. Some bones found in the same area were sent for analysis, but proved to be from an animal skeleton.

«When we have so little to go on, we have to turn to DNA profiling to find the answer.»

Forensic experts from Kristiansand went to take pictures and examine the body, but it had been in the sea for so long that there was not a lot left to examine. There was no sign of damage from propellers, stabbing or gunshot wounds. Unnhammer reckoned it was somebody who had gone missing in the North Sea and that the person would be identified quickly.

He turns to his computer and reads from the log. “At 3:02 pm, January 2, 2015, a diving suit with human remains was found at Lista.”

Sherriff Kåre Unnhammer from Farsund police station is an authoritative figure with large serious eyes, a big moustache and gold teeth that gleam when he speaks. It is a plesant day of April this year. In the waiting room, there is a warning against boat thieves and a poster stating that the legal size for cod caught south of 60 degrees latitude is 40 cm. In the middle ages, they burnt witches right outside this spot, but things are more relaxed now.

The wetsuit was the Triboard brand. The architect thought that it looked cheap. It was partially inside out. Stuck inside the legs of the suit, was a pair of blue flippers. Two white bones were sticking out of each one.

He could smell seaweed and the sea and a faint, sickly scent of something else.

The first thing the architect noticed when he approached the sea was a wetsuit. It lay stretched out on the small patch of grass between the cliffs, right outside the reach of the waves. “That might be useful,” the architect thought. It was rare for him or anyone else in the village to take a walk down there. The wetsuit could have been here for a long time.

A gale was blowing from the south-west as the elderly architect put on his jacket and rubber boots and went to face the elements. Down in the bay, four metre high waves crashed against the cliffs and sent sea spray hundreds of metres across the grazing land at Norway’s southernmost tip.

The sand sweeps across the ground in biting wind, making it difficult to see. A few hundred metres further on, in the grey-brown sand between two hilltops on the plains, a handful of refugees are walking in a cloud of dust, pushing a shopping basket filled with bottles of water against the wind. “No camera,” cries one of them when he sees us. He gestures angrily at us to go away. Surrounding us on all sides, blue, black and green plastic shimmers. Simple tents have been erected using poles, steel wire and plastic bags, at best. There are hundreds of them, spread everywhere on the large site which used to be a dump. Over 2000 so called illegal immigrants from all over the world live here. Twice as many are expected during the summer. They have almost no water, no electricity, no rules, no security, no heating, nothing. A muscular African man, almost two metres tall, and in his 20's, walks along the road towards the building complex where the refugees are one meal a day. This also houses the only water tap in the area. It is eleven in the morning. He is drunk and clutching a bottle of rosé from Lidl. He is crying loudly. His voice breaks. «I wanna go home», he cries. «I wanna go home to Africa». Welcome to the desolate, illness-infested and highly unofficial refugee camp in Calais. It is proof of the total failure of Western Europe’s attempts to treat refugees with the minimum of dignity. It is the camp nobody wanted, but which is here anyway and growing constantly. This is the camp with no name, but everybody knows what it’s called. Welcome to the Jungle. Calais with its 70,000 inhabitants is located at the spot where the English Channel is at its narrowest. It is 34 kilometres across to England. On good days, you can see the distinctive white limestone cliffs of Dover on the British side. Otherwise Calais is a fairly charmless city, a sleepy port of entry to France. The travel guide Lonely Planet describes the city as the place in the world where most people have passed through without stopping. The Eurotunnel is a few kilometres outside Calais. Massive trains transport cars and trucks in the tunnel under the channel. The ferry to Dover leaves from the port of Calais. The latest addition to the almost military guard is a five metre high and 20 km long barbed wire fence last used during a high-level NATO meeting in Wales. It was donated by the British authorities along with 12 million pounds in order to increase security around the ferry and the tunnel. The refugees in the Jungle have one goal only – to get to England. The question is how. At least 15 refugees from Calais died last year, including a 16-year-old girl. Most were run over on the motorway. One died when he jumped from a bridge down on to a passing truck. One was found dead in the river, one fell from his hiding place under the wheel axle of a tourist bus. There are also those who are not found in official lists, activists’ blogs or news reports. The ones nobody has heard of. The ones nobody remembers and nobody has enquired about. The refugee theory emerged when John Welzenbagh and his colleagues in the Netherlands managed to connect the wetsuits to Calais. A person with a permanent connection to Europe, a man from Calais or a regular tourist, would have been reported missing by family or friends. The police would have heard about it. Another thing that puzzeled Welzenbagh, was that the equipment on the receipt did not make sense. A strange combination of items made for competitive swimming, water aerobics and snorkling. He felt that nobody with a minimum of knowledge about water sports would have bought such a combination. Could they be refugees that tried to swim to England? In an industrial estate outside the centre of Calais, is the Decathlon sports shop. You can buy everything and it is cheap. When Magasinet arrives one morning at the end of April, most employees are busy. A young woman sorts out goods at the end of a rack separating surf boards and swimsuits. We explain that we are journalists from Norway and that two men have been found dead in wetsuits that were purchased here on October 7 last year. “I know that,” she says. “The police called. I was the one at the cash registry.” She says she must speak to the manager and will be gone for a short while. When she comes back she says that she cannot speak to us and that we must not mention the name of the sports shop if we write anything. We do a round of the shop and find her again some minutes later at the wetsuit rack. “They bought two of these,” she says quietly and points to one of the suits. She behaves as if she is nervous, keeps her voice down and makes sure that nobody sees that she is talking to us. “I remember them, but indistinctly. There were two young men, perhaps in the beginning of their 20's. They were refugees and looked as if they might be from Afghanistan,” she says. After finding the body on Texel, the Dutch police took pictures and sent them to an English expert who did an identikit picture of the man. We show it to the woman in the shop. “I can’t tell if it was one of them. I don’t remember.” “Did they say anything about what they were going to use the wetsuits for?” “No. But what I heard is that they swim out to small boats that take them over to England.” “Have refugees have been here buying wetsuits?” “I've been told by others who work here they do. It happens around once a month. I don’t know anything more.”

Afraid: Henok (26) fled from Eritrea, where he has a wife and a baby son. Now he lives in The Jungle in Calais. He will try to go to England in a semi trailer truck. - This is a dangerous place, he said.

Has anyone seen him?: Afghan refugees we talk to have not heard of anyone who has disappeared or tried to swim. They believe the man on the police sketch looks like one of the Hazara people.

The refugee problem in Calais began in 1999. In an unused hangar right by the tunnel, the Red Cross opened the Sangatte refugee centre. It was intended to give refuge to a hundred Kosovo Albanians who had fled the war in the Balkans. Three years later, Sangatte was a scandal and political abscess for France and England. A few hundred Kosovo refugees had turned into 1,600 refugees from the Middle East and Africa. Every single night hundreds of them tried to get to England by hiding in trucks heading for the ferry or the tunnel. Accusations were thrown back and forth over the channel about who was responsible. At Sangatte, there were riots between ethnic groups. Refugees cut holes in the fence and stormed the tunnel terminal. «Stop the invasion», was the headline on the front page of the English Daily Express. In December 2002, British Home Secretary David Blunkett announced that France had agreed to the closure of Sangatte. Refugees continued to come to Calais, but now they had nowhere to live. They began making their own homes. Some lived on the street, other set up small squatter areas in the city. Most settled on an industrial site belonging to one of Europe’ largest producers of titanium dioxide. That was the first «jungle» in Calais, the Tioxide Jungle. It is afternoon in what is now called the Jungle, or the New Jungle. Henok (26) fled the reign of terror in Eritrea and has been here one month. He wears jeans and an old flannel jacket. He speaks slowly, says little and has tired eyes that have seen too much. He leads us to an Eritrean area of the Jungle. Refugees mostly stay within their own ethnic groups. “This is a dangerous place,” he says. “We are cold, have no water and there are snakes here. It is not a place for human beings.” He explains that he left Eritrea eight months ago. First he went to Sudan, then through the Sahara to the civil war stricken and lawless Libya. He was taken by the police and put in prison for three weeks. He never found out why. Both soldiers and police in Libya are corrupt through and through. He bought himself out of prison for 500 dollars. Then he went to people traffickers in Tripoli, got money sent over from his family in Eritrea and paid 1700 dollars to be stowed away on a boat across the Mediterranean. “I can get killed in Eritrea, get killed in Libya or drown in the Mediterranean. I must try all the same.” His wife Bethelem (21) and son Fire-Ab Henok (20 months) are still in Eritrea. He thinks. He hasn’t spoken to them in several months. “I think about them all the time. Far too much. Every second,” he says. Before we manage to ask Henok if he has heard about any refugees who tried to swim or about people smugglers who use small boats over to England, we must stop the interview. The photographer outside the small circle of tent and an Ethiopian refugee tries to rob him. The Eritreans we are sitting with gets angry and the robber runs away. We are told to get out of there. “He might come back with more people. It is not safe for you here now.”

«If they see you taking pictures, you will be killed...» – Aid worker Georges Gilles about the people smugglers in Calais

Some hours later a fight breaks out in the Jungle between the Sudanese and Eritreans. We are told that they fought over whos turn it was to try to board trailers at the ferry. Some of them used knives during the fight. One of the few women who live in the Jungle ended up in hospital with burn injuries after her tent seemed to have been set on fire. Georges Gilles is a pensioner and has worked as a voluntary aid worker in Calais for four years. Every day he drives around in an old white Fiat van and gives out blankets, food and tarpaulins. It is never enough. We ask him if he knows anything about how the people smugglers operate. “They are everywhere, but stay in the shadows. They are often Kurds, Afghans or Albanians. Albanians are the worst.” The refugees who can afford to pay the smugglers are taken along motorways for tens of kilometres outside Calais to avoid strict security. At night, at rest stops and petrol stations, the smugglers hide the refugees inside and under parked trailers. “If I were you, I would stay out of there. If they see you taking pictures, you will be killed.” Everybody here has scars. Some are visible, others on the inside. Afghan Khalil Khaman Khalily (26) has several. One is 20 centimetres long and goes from his navel up to his ribcage. “Taliban,” he says. Khalil explains that he worked at a construction company that was hired by NATO in 2007, and that amongst other things he worked with the military camp at Shorabak in Helmand province. Five months ago he was kidnapped, locked up and stabbed when he was supposed to meet a potential new employer. “All Afghans who worked for NATO live dangerously,” he says. He managed to flee when one of the guards got drunk. He got help getting to Kabul and from there he fled to Europe. On the border from Iran to Turkey he was accused of being either an IS soldier or an Afghan spy and he says that he was tortured for two days until they understood that he didn’t have anything to say. The rest of his story is about cynical people smugglers and in the end flight on foot through the Balkans. He got into the EU and Hungary through the forest at the Serbian border town of Subotica. From there he travelled as a stowaway on the train to Paris and Calais. “I don’t feel safe here either. Look around you. The longer you are here, the more depressed you get.” During the 20 days he has been here, he has made 25 failed attempts to get to England where he has a brother studying IT. He dreams about becoming a military surgeon and travelling back to Afghanistan. “I must be careful because my wounds, but I will get to England when I can attempt a more risky approach,” he says. We ask if he has heard about refugees trying to swim. He laughs and shakes his head. “We barely manage to shower,” he laughs. We show him drawings of the man the police in the Netherlands call the wetsuitman. “He looks Afghan. I haven’t heard of him, but I haven’t been here long. People come here, then they leave as soon as they can.”

Marked: Khalil Khaman Khalily (26) says he was kidnapped and stabbed by the Taliban. Before that, he worked as a contractor for NATO and did construction work by military bases in Afghanistan.

Jungle of plastic: “The Jungle” is referred to as the worst refugee camp in Europe. The refugees here live in tents and plastic sheds made by what they can find."
Europe,2014-07-10,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Drowning,Netherlands,English Channel to the UK,"Body recovered on Texel, Netherlands on 27.10.2014",https://bit.ly/2LI6ELU,3,"Neither the DNA profile from the body in the Netherlands or Norway produced any hits internationally through Interpol. All leads in the case trail off in front of the cash register in Decathlon in Calais, barely an hour after sunset on October 7 last year.

The total for the goods was 256 euros. The customer paid cash. There is no surveillance footage from the shop.

When the serial number on the wetsuit was sent to Norway, it became clear where the other one had ended up. It was found by an architect during a winter storm in Lista, 850 kilometres from Calais, 87 days after it was purchased.

But there was more: There was two of everything on the receipt. Welzenbagh knew full well where one of the wetsuits was – in the evidence store in the Netherlands.

At 20.03 pm , Tuesday, October 7, 2014, a customer stood in front of the cash register of the Decathlon sports shop in the French port city of Calais by The English Channel. The customer bought a Triboard Subsea 5mm wetsuit, medium size, for 79 Euros. The customer also bought hand paddles – plates swimmers use on their hands to provide more resistance when they train, a snorkel and a diving mask, flippers, water socks – usually used for gymnastics in water and a waterproof A4 plastic folder.

John Welzenbagh knew this. When he discovered the little RFID-symbol on the tightly sewn tag with the wetsuit’s serial number and goods declaration, he knew he could find out where and when the suit was sold. And – if there was a credit card number on the receipt – who bought it. Here’s what he found out:

RFID stands for “Radio-Frequency Identification” and are tiny data chips that are used for everything from registering passengers in toll stations to identifying pets. They are also used in all sorts of goods, as a modern barcode system that stores information about where goods are moving from the time they are produced until they are scanned at a cash register and disappear into a shopping bag.

The wetsuit was the only strong clue Welzenbagh had to work with. A 5 millimetre thick neoprene wetsuit with a hood, made for diving and snorkelling in temperatures between 16 and 24 degrees. In the North Sea and The English Channel, water temperatures rarely rise above 15. At the end of October when the body was found, the normal temperature is an icy 10 degrees.

The police were back at square one. Fingerprints were impossible to reproduce. There were no papers or other characteristics and the DNA profile and missing report they sent out through Interpol met with no response.

“We had no way of knowing what kind of water sports he had been doing. If we called him the diver, I was afraid we would overlook clues that could help us. I said 'from now on, we will call him the wetsuitman'.”

“This was of course wrong, but even at our meetings he was known as the diver. I didn’t like that,” says Welzenbagh.

When the wetsuitman was found, four windsurfers were reported missing in England. The main theory in the first days was that one of them had floated ashore. The windsurfers had however already been found. The same went for a French diver who went missing outside Normandy. Still, Dutch media reported that the body found on Texel was a diver from France.

“I thought he might be from Spain. There are not many other places in Europe where you see that hair colour, in any case, not amongst ethnic Europeans,” he says.

There were not many physical characteristics to go on. The only thing Welzenbagh noticed was that the body had very dark hair.

How long had the wetsuitman been lying in the water? Three days? Three weeks? The rate of decay is difficult to assess when a person is in a wetsuit in cold water. Where did he come from? It was also impossible to say. Welzenbagh has found dead people from the entire North Sea and the Channel area: England, Scotland, France, Germany, Belgium and of course the Netherlands.

Every year Welzenbagh and the Dutch North Sea group get in between 20 and 30 bodies or remains for identification. Most turn out to have gone missing from the local area. Most of the cases are solved quickly.

The wetsuitman was found on Texel early in the morning on October 27 last year. He was wearing a black and grey wetsuit, identical to the wetsuit found with human remains inside at Lista 67 days later. The body was found along the water’s edge on the broad beach below the dunes and cafes in the small village of De Koog. It is a beach that is popular among windsurfers and tourists from all over the Netherlands come here in the summer.

Just a few weeks ago, he had a breakthrough in another case and is close to identifying an older, probably French, woman who floated ashore here 15 years ago.

On the ferry across from Den Helder to the island of Texel a couple of hours north of Amsterdam, Welzenbagh points to a sand bank and explains that he is still looking into the identity of a man who was found on a sailboat there in 1995.

Welzenbagh is a 52 years old former navy diver, he is fit and wears a dark windbreaker jacket and sports sunglasses. He is the kind of investigator who lies awake at night, pondering unsolved cases.

“We call him the wetsuitman,” says John Welzenbagh, investigator at the Netherlands special police unit for persons missing in the North Sea.

The Lista body is not the only one that drifted ashore in a grey and black Triboard wetsuit.

Every single night hundreds of them tried to get to England by hiding in trucks heading for the ferry or the tunnel. Accusations were thrown back and forth over the channel about who was responsible. At Sangatte, there were riots between ethnic groups. Refugees cut holes in the fence and stormed the tunnel terminal. «Stop the invasion», was the headline on the front page of the English Daily Express. In December 2002, British Home Secretary David Blunkett announced that France had agreed to the closure of Sangatte. Refugees continued to come to Calais, but now they had nowhere to live. They began making their own homes. Some lived on the street, other set up small squatter areas in the city. Most settled on an industrial site belonging to one of Europe’ largest producers of titanium dioxide. That was the first «jungle» in Calais, the Tioxide Jungle. It is afternoon in what is now called the Jungle, or the New Jungle. Henok (26) fled the reign of terror in Eritrea and has been here one month. He wears jeans and an old flannel jacket. He speaks slowly, says little and has tired eyes that have seen too much. He leads us to an Eritrean area of the Jungle. Refugees mostly stay within their own ethnic groups. “This is a dangerous place,” he says. “We are cold, have no water and there are snakes here. It is not a place for human beings.” He explains that he left Eritrea eight months ago. First he went to Sudan, then through the Sahara to the civil war stricken and lawless Libya. He was taken by the police and put in prison for three weeks. He never found out why. Both soldiers and police in Libya are corrupt through and through. He bought himself out of prison for 500 dollars. Then he went to people traffickers in Tripoli, got money sent over from his family in Eritrea and paid 1700 dollars to be stowed away on a boat across the Mediterranean. “I can get killed in Eritrea, get killed in Libya or drown in the Mediterranean. I must try all the same.” His wife Bethelem (21) and son Fire-Ab Henok (20 months) are still in Eritrea. He thinks. He hasn’t spoken to them in several months. “I think about them all the time. Far too much. Every second,” he says. Before we manage to ask Henok if he has heard about any refugees who tried to swim or about people smugglers who use small boats over to England, we must stop the interview. The photographer outside the small circle of tent and an Ethiopian refugee tries to rob him. The Eritreans we are sitting with gets angry and the robber runs away. We are told to get out of there. “He might come back with more people. It is not safe for you here now.”

«If they see you taking pictures, you will be killed...» – Aid worker Georges Gilles about the people smugglers in Calais

Some hours later a fight breaks out in the Jungle between the Sudanese and Eritreans. We are told that they fought over whos turn it was to try to board trailers at the ferry. Some of them used knives during the fight. One of the few women who live in the Jungle ended up in hospital with burn injuries after her tent seemed to have been set on fire. Georges Gilles is a pensioner and has worked as a voluntary aid worker in Calais for four years. Every day he drives around in an old white Fiat van and gives out blankets, food and tarpaulins. It is never enough. We ask him if he knows anything about how the people smugglers operate. “They are everywhere, but stay in the shadows. They are often Kurds, Afghans or Albanians. Albanians are the worst.” The refugees who can afford to pay the smugglers are taken along motorways for tens of kilometres outside Calais to avoid strict security. At night, at rest stops and petrol stations, the smugglers hide the refugees inside and under parked trailers. “If I were you, I would stay out of there. If they see you taking pictures, you will be killed.” Everybody here has scars. Some are visible, others on the inside. Afghan Khalil Khaman Khalily (26) has several. One is 20 centimetres long and goes from his navel up to his ribcage. “Taliban,” he says. Khalil explains that he worked at a construction company that was hired by NATO in 2007, and that amongst other things he worked with the military camp at Shorabak in Helmand province. Five months ago he was kidnapped, locked up and stabbed when he was supposed to meet a potential new employer. “All Afghans who worked for NATO live dangerously,” he says. He managed to flee when one of the guards got drunk. He got help getting to Kabul and from there he fled to Europe. On the border from Iran to Turkey he was accused of being either an IS soldier or an Afghan spy and he says that he was tortured for two days until they understood that he didn’t have anything to say. The rest of his story is about cynical people smugglers and in the end flight on foot through the Balkans. He got into the EU and Hungary through the forest at the Serbian border town of Subotica. From there he travelled as a stowaway on the train to Paris and Calais. “I don’t feel safe here either. Look around you. The longer you are here, the more depressed you get.” During the 20 days he has been here, he has made 25 failed attempts to get to England where he has a brother studying IT. He dreams about becoming a military surgeon and travelling back to Afghanistan. “I must be careful because my wounds, but I will get to England when I can attempt a more risky approach,” he says. We ask if he has heard about refugees trying to swim. He laughs and shakes his head. “We barely manage to shower,” he laughs. We show him drawings of the man the police in the Netherlands call the wetsuitman. “He looks Afghan. I haven’t heard of him, but I haven’t been here long. People come here, then they leave as soon as they can.”

Marked: Khalil Khaman Khalily (26) says he was kidnapped and stabbed by the Taliban. Before that, he worked as a contractor for NATO and did construction work by military bases in Afghanistan.

South-eastern Asia,2014-10-14,,4.0,4,,,4.0,,Unknown,Unknown,Drowning,Thailand,,"Thailand, north of Phuket",http://bit.ly/1txbmNy,3,"TAKUAPA: Four men are missing feared drowned today as the sudden arrival of more than 130 boatpeople turns Thailand's perceptions of human trafficking upside down.



Kidnapping is now a major new scourge.



Most of the scores of survivors now being processed north of Phuket are not minority Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution but everyday citizens of Bangladesh, seized and taken from near their homes by gangs with links to human traffickers extending south through Thailand to Malaysia.



Some of the men now being classified as human trafficking victims are not even Muslim, but Hindus, with families back in Bangladesh wondering where they have gone and whether they are still alive.



The local community around the Andaman coastal town of Takuapa has taken action over boatpeople into their own hands and made the point in no uncertain terms that the human trafficking industry is thriving in Thailand, no matter what government pronouncements say.



Since Phuketwan revealed the inhumane pushbacks of boats from Thailand in 2009, traffickers have grown their business along the coast south of Burma (Myanmar).



Like all businesses providing steady income for locals, the trafficking industry has strong support, providing jobs and income, with arrests seldom made by local law enforcers.



Now, a community revolution is underway. Catholic, Muslim and Buddhist organisations around Takuapa combined with district authorities last weekend to stage what amounted to a trafficking uprising to expose the evils of the flourishing people trade.



Instead of passing on newly arrived and apprehended boatpeople to local police, who always treat them as ''illegal immigrants,'' activist groups have processed them independently.



In doing so, the good people of the Takuapa district have revealed that this long-running saga of sanctuary seekers is now not just about volunteers boarding boats to travel south, but also about scores of people being kidnapped and shipped involuntarily to an uncetain future, probably as slave labor on boats or in factories.



The nightmare of Thailand's attempts to play down levels of trafficking has finally been revealed.



It's worth noting that Burma's attitude to the Rohingya in Rakhine state remains contemptuous, so more traditional boatpeople will flow to Thailand's shores between now and April, the ''safe'' sailing season.



Added to that, though, are now the kidnap victims from Bangladesh, people who had no plans to travel but who have found themselves in a foreign country.



This is supply and demand at its most horrific.



The human trafficking industry along Thailand's coast is now indisputably linking the labor sources of Bangladesh and Burma with the needs of fishing trawlers and factories in Malaysia and Indonesia.



It's time Thailand interrupted this shocking process and cleared the trafficking stain from its reputation, once and for all."

South African police have intensified searches for a five year old girl who went missing near the New Limpopo Bridge a fortnight ago when 11 illegal Malawian immigrants she was travelling with were attacked by a hippopotamus.Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Ronel Otto today confirmed that some of the immigrants had escaped with minor injuries following the

attack. She said the girl and her mother were part of the group which wanted to enter that country illegally through Beitbridge border post on the

night of December 31.

“Along the way they were chased by a hippopotamus and some sustained minor injuries. They ran away in all directions and since then the five year old girl went missing” she said.

“Despite extended searches nothing has been found yet. Members of the SAPS search and rescue unit as well as the Air wing intensified search operations during the weekend”.

She said the mother tried to look for the girl without success for a week until she reported to the police last week. The police spokesperson urged members of the public to ensure that they are documented and to make use of official entry points to avoid risking their lives of prosecution.

“Too many people die trying to enter illegally whether it is through drowning, attacks by animals or being attacked by heartless criminals who rape, rob or kill”.

There are an estimated 200 illegal crossing points between South Africa and Zimbabwe’s boundary line. The rampant illegal movement of people and smuggling of goods between the two countries have seen border authorities intensifying patrol on both sides of the river.

In December alone a total of 200 children were intercepted along the boundary line while being smuggled to South Africa. Three people including a nine year old boy were attacked and killed by a hippo near the same scene while trying to illegally cross into South Africa. In may last year two criminals who were in the habit of waylaying and robbing border jumpers at the spillway and Dulibadzimu gorges respectively were also killed by a hippo along the same river.

A few months ago a gang of 18 men including suspected border jumpers and fisherman teamed up and killed a crocodile which wanted to attack them at an illegal crossing point along the Limpopo River some 900 meters east of the Alfred BeitBridge."

Roymar Bello screamed. She was one of 17 passengers who had climbed onto the overloaded fishing boat with aging motors in July, hoping to escape Venezuela’s economic disaster for a new life on the Caribbean island of Curaçao.

Afraid of the authorities, the smuggler refused to land. Ms. Bello said he gruffly ordered her and the others into the water, pointing toward the distant shore. In the panic, she was tossed overboard, tumbling into the predawn blackness.

But Ms. Bello could not swim.

As she began to sink under the waves, a fellow migrant grabbed her by the hair and towed her toward the island. They washed up on a rocky cliff battered by waves. Bruised and bleeding, they climbed, praying for a lifeline: jobs, money, something to eat.

A family of four are facing deportation from Swansea after a terrifying journey in which the father of the three children and another dad froze to death.

The Sedeeq and Rebwah families fled Iraq in 2015 and managed to make it all the way to Bulgaria.

Mr and Mrs Rebwah had four young children whilst the Sedeeq family had three. All seven children are cousins.

While staying in a refugee camp, one day both fathers left to go and find food for their families. They never returned.

The men both froze to death, leaving the mothers behind to look after seven children.

An uncle of both the families, Aram Faraj, lives in Swansea where he has permanent UK residence. Mr Faraj waited nine months for permission to bring the families back to the UK. During that time frame Mrs Rebwah died, leaving four children as orphans.

Both families managed to make it to Swansea where they have been helped by Swansea Bloom, an arm of the Linden Church which helps asylum seekers and refugees to integrate through visits, friendship and creating opportunities.

Rachel Matthews of Swansea Bloom said: “They have a great support network in Swansea from Aram and from Bloom who provide weekly support.”

The four Rebwah orphans; Alwand 5, Rozhan 8, Omar 11 and Rekan 13 have been granted a stay in the UK for the next two and a half years living with their Uncle.

However, The Sedeeq mother and children have not been so fortunate. Trifa and her three children Mohammed 12, Dani 11, Marwar 5, have not been granted asylum in the UK and are facing deportation.

The family were originally offered accomodation in Wrexham by the home office, which the family refused, so that they could be with the other children in Swansea.

Ms Matthews said the mother, Trifa, “has been diagnosed with PTSD and has trauma induced seizures”.

Trifa’s oldest son, Mohammed, also has trauma induced seizures.

Ms Matthews said: ”The kids are doing great in school but have all lost ground since the home office refused. Seizures have restarted, the children have terrible anxiety about being taken by the police and are having nightmares.”

The family have no-one or any support network in Iraq to go back to. They want to settle in the UK to get the support for the trauma they have been through.

Their tragic story has even been featured on the Wild Pictures documentary shown on ITV, Forgotten Children .

Bethan Jenkins AM will be seeking to put forward an urgent question to the First Minister next week calling for a statement on any urgent representations that he is willing to make with the UK Government about the rejected asylum application of the Rebwah family.

Bethan Jenkins AM said: “This is a truly awful situation and I cannot believe that the UK Government are being so heartless in how they make these decisions.

“There is nobody in Iraq that could care for them. Their uncle is a British citizen and has guardianship, so as a local community we cannot understand why the UK Government has decided that they cannot stay.

""They are vulnerable and need support, and have recently been awarded funding for therapy for the trauma they experienced before arriving in Wales, and that is due to start soon. The local community have been so supportive of the family, and will campaign robustly against their deportation.

""These are innocent children that deserve our support and warrant sanctuary here in Wales.”

Rachel Matthews is currently fundraising to help furnish the council home that the Rebwah orphans have been granted with their uncle. You can help by contacting: https:// www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/rachel-matthews-2?utm_id=106&utm_term=jWqQ5b5en"

Mohammed Akram, 22, had been with a group of around five other men who were making their way across the motorway near junction 8 for Leeds when he was struck by a van.

It happened on the London-bound carriageway just before 7am on October 14 last year, leaving the road shut for seven hours.

The scene of the fatal crash on the M20

At an inquest into his death at The Archbishop’s Palace, evidence was heard from the driver of the white VW Caddy, Phillip Ritchie, who had been travelling to work in Ashford when the accident happened.

In a statement he described seeing four or five people.

He said: “It was dark at the time. Suddenly I could see four maybe five people in the road all following each other, sort of spaced out. I have done a double take. It looked so unreal, they looked like ghosts.”

The inquest heard Mr Ritchie had gone to brake, but was too late. He said he didn’t swerve for fear of hitting the other migrants or crashing into the central reservation.

Mr Akram’s body was then run over by another car. He died at the scene from multiple injuries.

Det Con David Holmes of Kent Police’s Serious Collision Unit said Europol had helped the force to piece together Mr Akram’s movements.

There has been a crash on the M20

He had left Afghanistan 18 months earlier with a friend and had paid a people smuggler for travel into Iran. He then went through Turkey, Greece and Germany, where he registered as a refugee.

His ID card was found near the body, but in order to identify Mr Akram, his father in Afghanistan had to make a dangerous nine hour journey to Kabul to give a DNA sample.

Assistant coroner Allison Summers concluded Mr Akram’s death was the result of an accident, adding: “Whatever this man’s reason for coming to the UK this was a tragic loss of a young life and I don’t underestimate the effects of this on the drivers involved.”"

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Authorities recovered the bodies Tuesday of at least 36 migrants who drowned off Turkey after their boats overturned in rough waters as they tried to reach the Greek island of Lesbos, officials and news reports said. Twelve others were rescued.

Nine bodies, including those of children, washed up on a beach in the resort town of Ayvalik early in the morning, prompting authorities to dispatch coast guard boats and gendarmerie officials to search the area by sea and by land for possible survivors.

Seven other bodies were washed up on a shore at Dikili, a resort about 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Ayvalik, the victims of a second migrant tragedy, the private Dogan news agency reported. The dead included women and children, the agency said.

By late afternoon, the gendarmerie forces had recovered a total of 29 bodies in the area while seven others were found by the coast guards, a Coast Guard statement said, without providing details.

Around 850,000 migrants and refugees crossed into Greece last year, paying smuggling gangs to ferry them over from Turkey in frail boats.

Undeterred by the bitter cold and the rough winter seas, migrants are continuing to risk the journey to Greece in the hope of a better future in Europe. Most of them are Syrian refugees escaping the civil war.

The International Organization for Migration estimates that 3,771 migrants overall died while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe last year. It says that makes it the deadliest year on record for migrants crossing the Mediterranean, with the number of deaths rising from 3,279 in 2014.

The IOM said 2,892, or 77 percent, of the deaths last year were on the central Mediterranean route, mainly involving people crossing from Libya. However, there were 805 deaths in the eastern Mediterranean, accounting for 21 percent of the total. That's 1 percent more than the previous year, reflecting the increasing popularity of that route.

Top officials from Denmark, Sweden and Germany, meanwhile, were scheduled to hold talks in Brussels on Wednesday amid concern about new border control measures aimed at stopping migrants entering northern Europe, EU officials said Tuesday.

Sweden introduced ID checks on all people entering from Denmark, and Denmark tightened border controls on its border with Germany on Monday for at least 10 days, citing concerns about public security because of migrant movements and border measures taken by other EU member states.

Danish officials said 18 people without proper ID were refused entry from Germany in the first 12 hours of the increased border crossing checks. Three people were also arrested, suspected of human smuggling.

In Turkey, Namik Kemal Nazli, the local administrator for Ayvalik, told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the victims of the first incident are believed to be from Iraq, Algeria and Syria. There was no information on the nationalities of those drowned in the second incident.

A body with a lifejacket was pulled from the sea onto the beach at Ayvalik by a fisherman and a military police official, Dogan news agency video footage showed. Other bodies, also in lifejackets, were seen lying nearby.

Somalia - Some 36 migrants died when a ship carrying at least 106 Ethiopian and Somali migrants sank off the coast of the Somaliland autonomous region in northern Somalia on Friday, according to IOM Somalia.

IOM, in partnership with the Migrant Response Center (MRC) in Somaliland, is supporting local authorities to provide food, water, and medicine for the survivors. It also provided trucks to move the migrants from Harasho, where they landed, to the capital of Sanaag, Erigavo, to receive medical attention.

According to staff from the MRC, the survivors were all dehydrated and emaciated and many needed urgent medical attention. Those who were in critical condition were referred to a local hospital, where they are being treated by an IOM supported medical team.

When the migrants are fit to travel, IOM, in close cooperation with UNHCR, DRC and government partners, will move them first to the UNHCR-managed Berbera reception centre, where they will stay overnight, be registered and screened to determine their protection needs.

Today (12/1) 62 migrants will travel to Berbera. The remaining eight will remain under the care of doctors at Erigavo Hospital until they are fit to travel. They will then travel on to Hargeisa, where they will be supported through the Migrant Response Centre and the Ethiopian Community Centre. Migrants who choose to return home may then be offered IOM assisted voluntary return.

Every year, thousands of people die in the waters off the coast of Africa while trying to reach Yemen in order to escape conflict-ridden situations and poor economic prospects at home. Yemen serves as a gateway to the rich Gulf countries in the Middle East.

Somalis, Eritreans and Ethiopians make up for most of the migrants who look to cross the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea trying to reach Yemen and beyond in precarious boats, often controlled by unscrupulous human traffickers.

",http://dailym.ai/1T7zAIQ,1,"The body of a man has been found in the landing gear of a plane in Paris after the passenger jet touched down in Europe after an 11 hour flight from Brazil.

The stowaway was discovered clinging to the Air France plane's landing gear during maintenance operations on the Boeing 777 at Orly Airport yesterday.

Having arrived from Sao Paulo, the plane had flown to the smaller airport in Paris after touching down at Charles de Gaulle airport two days earlier.

The man's body was found inside the wheel-well of the Air France plane after it arrived in Paris from Brazil

The body is now undergoing examination at Paris' forensic institute so it can be identified, an airport source said.

In a similar case in 2013, a dead stowaway was found in the landing gear of a plane that had landed at Charles de Gaulle from Cameroon.

Several dozen incidents of the passenger jet wheel-wells being used by stowaways have emerged since commercial aviation began.

However, they are usually unsuccessful due to the lack of oxygen and freezing temperatures at the high altitudes passenger jets travel.

Desperate travellers have been found frozen inside the wheel-wells or fallen from the compartment when the plane extends its landing gear.

Pieces of other stowaways are reported to have fallen from the sky into cities and residential areas after the person is crushed by the landing gear during the flight.

In June, the body of a man was found on the roof on an office block in Richmond after he fell from the plane upon its approach to Heathrow Airport.

While he had perished during the 11-hour flight from Johannesburg, a second stowaway survived but was left fighting for his life in hospital."

According to law enforcement officials, the man was found dead Sunday morning. Then he had been waiting at the checkpoint for five days, since January 12th. Those five days have been some of the coldest this winter with temperatures dropping below minus 30 degree Celsius in the area.

Eyewitnesses say the man, reportedly a Indian citizen, had been shivering in the car for a few days, Flashnord reports. Komsomolskaya Pravda reports that the man did not get help from others because he could not pay for “service.”

The numbers of migrants on the Arctic Route heading for Finland’s Salla border have increased substantially since Norway introduced stricter immigration rules in late November last year. Since November 29th, not one single migrant without legal entry visa to Norway has been let through Russia’s Borisoglebsk border checkpoint and subsequently not entered Norway at Storskog.

This weekend, 52 migrants have entered Lapland from Russia at Salla, Finland’s Border Guard reports. So far in 2016, 306 persons have applied for asylum at Raja-Jooseppi (Ivalo) and Salla border checkpoints.

The majority are Afghans, Nepalese, Indians, Iranians and Iraqis.

Last week, the Independent Barents Observer reported that groups of people, including children, started to walk on the road from Kandalaksha towards Salla. The people were rescued by the local medical service in Alakurtti because of the freezing cold weather.

After the incident with the walking migrants in the frost, regional authorities on Saturday decided to open the hotel in Kandalaksha for migrants awaiting transport to the Finnish border, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. The newspaper also informs that many migrants have been staying in cars on the road for days in the extreme cold weather, with temperatures down to minus 40 degree Celsius.

The reason why the migrants choose to stay for days in the cars in line for the checkpoint to Alakurtti is said to be because they don’t want to lose their number in the queue.

The road from Kandalaksha, via Alakurtti and further to Salla goes through some of the most remote wilderness areas on the Kola Peninsula with very few buildings along the road."

A five-year-old child and a woman died of hypothermia after two boats capsized. At least 46 people were rescued, while the number of missing remains unknown.

Despite the rough seas, the flow of desperate people fleeing war zones seeking refuge in Europe continues unabated.

On Tuesday, according to the Greek Coast Guard officials, 1,028 people reached the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea on boats provided by smugglers.

More than 800,000 people landed on Greek shores in 2015, half of them on Lesvos, according to official statistics.

Greece is a transit country, as the overwhelming majority of refugees and migrants continue their journey to other more prosperous European countries.

The next stage of the trip, crossing from Greece into the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), is not without obstacles.

At least 600 refugees were stranded on Tuesday at Idomeni, a border crossing between Greece and Macedonia, in subzero temperatures, according to Greek authorities.

Skopje closed the border crossing due to congestion caused by a train breaking down on the international railroad line to Slovenia, according to a Macedonian foreign ministry announcement.

In the meantime, the refugees, mainly from Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, sought refuge at a gas station on Tuesday near the border crossing while waiting for it to reopen.

On Wednesday, following the intervention of several humanitarian organizations, Greek authorities reopened a temporary camp that had been set up by nongovernmental groups in August and closed in December, as Athens was under culminating pressure from European partners to stem the flow of people. The camp can accommodate about 2,000 people in heated tents. Endit"

The UN Refugee Agency is extremely alarmed at reports of two dead bodies being found on the Bulgarian border with Serbia, last week. UNHCR is seeking further details after being alerted about the deaths by the Bulgarian Border Police. The two men, apparently, have died of cold while trying to cross into Serbia from Western Bulgaria.

Initial details shared by the Bulgarian authorities indicate locals finding the bodies (one around January 20 and the second on January 23) in the mountainous areas along the border at separate locations in Western Bulgaria, following a very cold spell as temperatures dropped to -21 degree Celsius. The two were found dressed lightly.

The nationalities of both men are unknown and neither of them were known to the authorities. The two men are believed by UNHCR to be part of the refugee, migrant group movements passing through the irregular border points to seek safety in Europe.

""These recent tragic incidents once again highlights the risks that desperate people are forced to take in absence of legal avenues to seek safety in Europe,"" said Montserrat Feixas Vihé, UNHCR's Regional Representative for Central Europe

Desperate people continue to arrive in Bulgaria, majority of them through the land borders from Turkey. Around 30,000 are estimated to arrive last year - a large proportion from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of those attempt to enter Serbia from Bulgaria through the border mountainous region, while trying to continue their journey onwards in Europe.

UNHCR also remains concerned about continuing reports of push-backs and allegations of abuse in Bulgaria for those who try to access asylum in the country. Many of those people, reported to be pushed-back, could be in need of international protection, who must have access to asylum in Bulgaria.

""Sadly, push-backs, putting up barriers and building fences in the way of a refugee population leaves people with no choice, but to hand themselves to ruthless smugglers and human traffickers,"" UNHCR's Feixas Vihé further added.

These concerns have been raised with authorities in Sofia. UNHCR regrets that reports of push-backs and allegations of abuse continue to emerge and emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation by authorities.

Bilgiç said in a statement on Tuesday that 23 Iraqi and two Syrian migrants who were rescued off of Turkey's western Foça coast can be sent to the KRG if they wish.

“We are working to quickly transfer the bodies upon the request of the KRG. The transportation process is about to be completed. Moreover, we will send the rescued migrants as soon as possible to the KRG if they wish. We are extending all the support we can to the KRG in this regard,” the statement read.

The boat, carrying 49 migrants, capsized off the coast of Foça on Jan. 21, and fishermen called the Turkish Coast Guard to come to the rescue. Twenty-five refugees were saved, while 13 migrants, five of whom were children, died and 11 went missing.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the number of migrant and refugee deaths in the Mediterranean, so far, has already made this ""the deadliest January on record.""

The total number of arrivals in Europe by sea has risen to about 37,000 this month, more than six times the figure for the same month in 2014 and 2015 combined. January is usually a slow month due to bad weather.

Fleeing war, thousands of mainly Syrian refugees have braved rough seas to make the short, but precarious, journey from Turkey to Greece's islands, from which most continue to mainland Greece and northward into wealthier Western Europe. Winter conditions make the journey even more dangerous.

At least five migrants were found dead off Turkey’s western coast on Jan. 26 after their boat capsized as they were trying to reach the Greek coast.Fishermen in the Didim district of Aydın province in Turkey’s Aegean region informed coast guards of the dead migrants upon noticing their bodies floating on the water. The Turkish Coast Guard removed the five bodies from the water and rescued one migrant, who was not reported to be in a life-threatening condition.The rescued migrant said there were another 16 migrants on the boat.Turkish coast guards have begun search and rescue operations to locate the other migrants.Meanwhile, in the northwestern province of Balıkesir, 28 migrants and 12 human smugglers were caught during two different police operations in the coastal Ayvalık district on Jan. 26.A motorboat and eight vehicles including two taxis owned by smugglers were seized during the operations by district police’s anti-smuggling and organized crime teams.The group of smugglers was attempting to transport migrants to the Greek island of Lesbos through the Turkish island of Cunda off Ayvalık. The suspects, who are said to be from Istanbul, Şırnak, Balıkesir and Ayvalık, were sent to court, while 10 of them were arrested.Since the beginning of 2016, some 24 smugglers have been arrested, according to local reports.In a deal reached late 2015, the European Union decided to give 3 billion euros to Turkey tackle the Syrian refugee influx into the EU, in exchange for accelerated talks on Turkey’s EU accession.Despite the deal and reports of tightened control from the Turkish authorities, migrants and refugees continue to risk the perilous sea route trying to reach the shores of Greece.Tens of thousands of migrants have been rescued and the lifeless bodies of hundreds of others have been retrieved from the Aegean Sea over the past year.Statistics from the Turkish Coast Guard Command revealed that 59,377 migrants were rescued and the dead bodies of 339 others were retrieved from the Aegean Sea in 2015 as thousands of migrants, particularly Syrians arriving fleeing their war-torn country, failed to cross to Greek islands as what they see as a first step to reach European counties. This number had been 2,205 three years ago, and the number of migrants rescued was five times that of 2014.Traumatic images of Syrian toddler Aylan Kurdi, whose body washed up on a beach in the southwestern resort town of Bodrum in September 2015, brought the world’s attention to the daily tragedy taking place on Turkey’s western shores."

At least three Syrian migrants, including two children, drowned early on Jan. 31 in a fresh migrant boat tragedy off the western Turkish resort town of Didim.Some other 12 migrants were rescued by Turkish Coast Guard teams off Didim, a district in the Aegean province of Aydın, early on Jan. 31 after fishermen noticed them floating on the sea following the capsizing of their boat en route to the Greek island of Farmakonisi.Humanitarian aid was provided to the rescued migrants as they were brought to the Didim District Coast Guard Command.The bodies of three drowned migrants were sent to the Didim Public Hospital and later to the morgue of the forensic institute in the Aegean province of İzmir.Meanwhile, the three human traffickers, including a foreign national, were detained for organizing the boat journey that killed at least 39 migrants off Ayvacık, a district in the northwestern province of Çanakkale on Jan. 31. The three traffickers were later formally arrested.At least five children were among the 39 drowned after their boat bound for the Greek island of Lesbos sank. Among the casualties were nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar and Syria.Of the more than 1.1 million refugees who arrived in the EU last year, more than 850,000 arrived by sea in Greece from Turkey, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Over the course of 2015, a total of 805 people died in the Aegean.In the first month of 2016, more than 52,000 people arrived by sea in Greece and 218 died off the Turkish coast, the IOM said.Geographically located between war-torn Syria and Iraq in the southeast and the EU member states of Bulgaria and Greece in the northwest, Turkey has become a transition point for migrants looking to illegally cross into the EU, fleeing the violence in Iraq and Syria and seeking a higher standard of living.The wave of migration across the Aegean Sea has often resulted in injuries and deaths due to either the capsizing of migrant-carrying boats or abuse of migrants by human traffickers."

Peruvian police say the 27-year-old bled to death after the mine exploded late Sunday near a Peruvian border control post. He was identified on Monday as Francy Mamani Aquino.

A Colombian citizen was injured by a mine nearby last year.

In 2012, a Peruvian taxi exploded in a minefield, killing at least one person in the same area. Authorities said the driver went off-road and entered a well-marked minefield in an apparent attempt to avoid border controls.

Three of the boat’s passengers were rescued by the coastguard, while a fourth was rescued by a fisherman. A search operation was still underway for nine others.

The boat sank in the Aegean Sea near the Edremit area of the north-western province of Balikesir, about two miles off the Turkish coast.



More than 850,000 refugees arrived in Greece via the perilous sea route last year, making up the majority of the more than 1.1 million refugees who reached the EU.

While many expected numbers to drop over the winter, refugees have continued to make their way across the sea despite low temperatures and heavy storms. Last month marked the deadliest January on record, with more than 250 deaths.

Turkey, a country that hosts about 2.5 million Syrian refugees, the largest such population in the world, says that it does not have the capacity to host any more. According to the Turkish government, almost 30,000 Syrians are currently waiting at the Turkish-Syrian border, fleeing an attack by government forces on Aleppo.



The Turkish government struck a highly controversial deal with the EU in November, under which the EU pledged €3bn (£2.2bn) and political concessions to Turkey in exchange for increased border patrols, a crackdown on human smuggling networks and irregular migration.

Local activists and NGOs have harshly criticised European migration policies and ever tighter border security.

“These accidents happen every day,” said Eda Bekçi, a lawyer who volunteers at the refugee aid group Mülteci-Der in Izmir. “Just a few days ago a boat capsized and nine people were killed. These people will keep leaving, and Europe needs to finally understand that shutting down their borders and increasing security measures will lead to more refugees dying on these borders.”

Turkey has put in place a range of measures in order to curb the number of Syrian refugees going to Europe, such as putting in place visa requirements for Syrians arriving from third countries.

The government has also agreed to grant work visas to Syrians living in Turkey. Over 400,000 Syrians are currently working illegally in the country, without insurance and for salaries below the already meagre minimum wage, according to a report published by the Turkish Confederation of Employer Associations (TISK) at the end of last year.

Ankara has also promised to designate human smuggling as a form of organised crime, a measure that would mean harsher punishment for perpetrators, but human rights activists warn that such crackdowns would only push refugee trafficking deeper underground, and that smugglers would try to find ever riskier – and deadlier – routes for those trying to reach Europe.

“It is high time for Europe to put in place legal ways to secure the safe passage for those desperate enough to risk the dangerous sea journey,” said Eda Bekçi. “We need practical solutions to stop more people from dying this way. It is clear that they do not want to stay in Turkey, as things stand.”

Nesrin Berdo was reportedly traveling with her daughter and relatives from Aleppo to Istanbul.The body of the toddler was taken to the Adana Forensic Institute for medical examination. An initial study indicated the baby had died from malnutrition and cold weather.Tens of thousands of Syrians have fled violence in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo in an endeavor to take refuge in Turkey, as violence escalated in the historic city with a Russia-backed bombardment by the Syrian army."

Aunque a muchos pueda llegar a sorprenderles la esclavitud no solamente era propia de países que se encuentran más allá de nuestras fronteras. De hecho el tráfico de esclavos estuvo presente en España durante no pocos años, algo que muchos se empeñan en intentar olvidar para que la marca que mancha nuestro país no se extienda aún más.

Muchos artistas como Goya, Velazquez e incluso Cervantes han hablado de estos hechos en sus obras, hechos que durante el siglo de Oro estuvieron muy presentes en la España de la época.

Casi sesenta mil esclavos vivieron en nuestro país a finales del siglo XVI, y aunque a partir de este punto esta cifra fue decreciendo hasta la desaparición de la esclavitud no deja de ser un dato realmente sorprendente."

Press Release

Military-style solutions won’t solve humanitarian problems, argues our new report that details the nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the English Channel since 1999. Deadly Crossings and the Militarisation of Britain’s Borders reveals the human tragedies caused by inhumane border enforcement at a time when the UK Home Office is seeking to make Channel crossings ‘unviable’

A transnational collaboration between the IRR, the Permanent People’s Tribunal London steering group & French group Gisti, Deadly Crossings is the first English-language analysis of Channel-related deaths. Published within weeks of the UK exit from the European Union, the report argues that far from the UK getting a handle on border control post-Brexit, further securitisation of its borders will only result in more human suffering.

PPT member, Don Flynn said, “The UK government tries to present migrant Channel crossings as a failing on the French side. But much of the hardship in the Calais region stems from the refusal of the British government to provide a safe passage for people with a legitimate claim to asylum in this country. This report is a tool for people who believe that the UK’s border policies need to be changed. What exists at the moment is nothing more than the extension of the brutality of the hostile environment to refugees.”

Translated from a publication originally written in French by Maël Galisson of Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France, the report features a timeline which shows the deaths chronologically; and an interactive map, showing them geographically.

With no official records chronicling the deaths of people trying to cross the Channel, the total number cannot be known, but it is hoped this report will give each person included an identity and a history. Galisson said, “This report is about challenging the idea that this massacre is the result of misfortune. Reducing these tragedies to accidents or framing them in terms of violence occurring between migrants, as we often see in the media, is a way of concealing the responsibility of public authorities for a situation that has lasted for more than twenty years”.

IRR Vice-Chair Frances Webber said, “These deaths are not ‘natural’ nor ‘tragic accidents’ but man-made, created by policies which do not merely close borders but also erect ever more obstacles to safe travel for the most vulnerable. Military-style solutions don’t solve humanitarian problems. They simply create more profit for the smugglers, and more suffering for the migrants. The history of the securitisation of the English Channel is a history of death. So why do we allow the government to keep on along the same path?"

ÇANAKKALE

Rescuers try to revive a person after a boat carrying refugees sank off on its way to Lesbos Island at Ayvacık district, Çanakkale on March 10, 2016. AFP Photo





At least five migrants, including a baby, drowned late on March 9 as they tried to sail from Turkey to Greece.The raft, which was transporting Afghan and Iranian migrants to the Greek island of Lesbos, foundered just 500 meters from the Turkish coast of Ayvacık in the province of Çanakkale.Turkish coastguards managed to save nine of the migrants on board while two were still missing.The fresh tragedy came as the European Union and Turkey are trying to firm up a proposed deal to end the worst migration crisis to hit the continent since World War II.On March 7, Turkey proposed a deal that would see the EU resettle one Syrian refugee from camps in Turkey in exchange for every Syrian that Turkey takes from Greece, in a bid to reduce the incentive for people to board boats for Europe.In return, Turkey wants financial aid, visa-free access to Europe's passport-free Schengen zone and a speeding up of Ankara's efforts to join the EU.EU leaders hope to finalize the deal at a summit on March 17-18."

Western Asia,2016-03-20,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Violence,Syrian Arab Republic,Syria to Türkiye,"Syrian/Turkish border, Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing",http://bit.ly/1Wm8lNP,4,"(Istanbul) – Turkish border guards are shooting and beating Syrian asylum seekers trying to reach Turkey, resulting in deaths and serious injuries, Human Rights Watch said today. The Turkish authorities should stop pushing Syrian asylum seekers back at the border and should investigate all use of excessive force by border guards.

During March and April 2016, Turkish border guards used violence against Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers, killing five people, including a child, and seriously injuring 14 others, according to victims, witnesses, and Syrian locals interviewed by Human Rights Watch. Turkey’s Foreign Affairs Ministry maintains the country has an “open-door policy” for Syrian refugees, despite building a new border wall.



“While senior Turkish officials claim they are welcoming Syrian refugees with open borders and open arms, their border guards are killing and beating them,” said Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Firing at traumatized men, women, and children fleeing fighting and indiscriminate warfare is truly appalling.”



Since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards have pushed back Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April 2016, Human Rights Watch reported that Turkish border guards enforcing Turkey’s one-year-old border closure had shot at Syrians escaping advances by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), northeast of Aleppo. Human Rights Watch also revealed how Turkish border guards blocked thousands of fleeing displaced persons after their camps near the border had been hit by artillery fire on April 13 and 15.

The hostilities continue to threaten Syrians already displaced by fighting. According to witnesses, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, three airstrikes hit the Kamuna camp sheltering 4,500 displaced Syrians near Sarmada in northern Idlib province, five kilometers from Turkey’s increasingly impenetrable border. An independent humanitarian source in Turkey told Human Rights Watch that medics recovered 20 bodies, including two children, and that at least 37 people were injured, including 10 who lost one or more limbs and who were transferred to Turkey for medical care.



According to the Syrian Civil Defense, seven women and four children were also injured on April 24, when three artillery rounds fired by Syrian government forces hit al-Iqaa displaced persons camp near al-Zawf, located six kilometers northeast of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing. According to camp representatives, the al-Iqaa camp shelters many Syrians who have previously been pushed back by Turkish border guards.

Human Rights Watch interviewed victims and witnesses involved in seven incidents between the first week of March and April 17, in which Turkish border guards shot dead three asylum seekers (one man, one woman, and a 15-year-old boy) and one smuggler; beat to death one smuggler; shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three children, aged 3, 5, and 9; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers. Syrians living near the border also described the aftermaths of the shootings and beatings, including Turkish border guards firing at them as they tried to recover bodies at the border wall. One witness filmed a number of the dead and surviving victims and shared the videos with Human Rights Watch.



On May 4, Human Rights Watch sent a letter with these findings to the Turkish interior minister, urging Turkey to investigate the allegations made by Human Rights Watch, to order its guards not to shoot at asylum seekers, and to re-open its border to Syrians seeking safety.



Six of the incidents Syrian witnesses described took place near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, about 50 kilometers south of the Turkish city of Antakya. The seventh happened near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya. Seven of the injured people said they had briefly stayed in the Salaheddin camp for displaced persons in the village of Khurbat al-Juz, overlooking the newly-erected Turkish border wall nearby. Most of them, and others who traveled straight to the border, said they had recently fled fighting in and around Aleppo.





Between April 12 and 20, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 28 other Syrian asylum seekers who described Turkish border guards intercepting them as they crossed the border with smugglers between February and mid-April. They said guards detained them for up to a day, then pushed them back to Syria with dozens – and in some cases hundreds – of others. Some were living in the Khirmash IDP camp to the west of the Syrian town of Bidama. A representative of the camp told Human Rights Watch that on April 13, Turkish border guards in the nearby watchtowers used loudspeakers to announce in Arabic that no one should approach the border and that anyone who did would be shot.



Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by land army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since such specific information was not provided or known by many witnesses.



As of early April, Turkey had completed a third of its 911-kilometer rocket-resistant concrete wall along its border with Syria and was working to fortify the rest of its border.



Turkey is entitled to secure its border with Syria, but is obliged to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits rejecting asylum seekers at borders when that would expose them to the threat of persecution, torture, and threats to life and freedom. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity, including the absolute prohibition on subjecting anyone to inhuman and degrading treatment.

The violence against Syrian refugees, and Turkey’s refusal to allow them to cross the border, comes as the European Union has shut its own borders to asylum seekers. In March, the EU concluded a controversial migration deal with Ankara to curb refugee and migration flows to Europe, committing €6 billion in aid to assist Syrians in Turkey, reinvigorating Turkey’s EU membership negotiations, and offering the prospect of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal provides for Europe to return migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, including Syrians, who reach Greece by boat, on the grounds that Turkey is a safe country for them. The deal also commits the EU to work with Turkey to create areas inside Syria that will be “more safe.”



“The EU shouldn’t just stand by and watch as Turkey uses live ammunition and rifle butts to stem the refugee flow,” said Simpson. “EU officials should recognize that their red light for refugees to enter the EU gives Turkey a green light to close its border, exacting a heavy price on war-ravaged asylum seekers with nowhere else to go.”



Turkish border guard violence against Syrian refugees

In mid-April 2016, Human Rights Watch interviewed four victims, five witnesses, and six local Syrian residents who described seven occasions in March and April in which Turkish border guards shot or assaulted 17 Syrian asylum seekers and two smugglers. During the incidents, Turkish border guards killed five people (shot to death three asylum seekers and a smuggler and beat to death one smuggler); shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three young children; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers.



Six of the incidents occurred near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, near the Turkish town of Antakya, and one near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya.



Human Rights Watch also interviewed six Syrians from Khurbat al-Juz who helped some of the survivors and retrieved the bodies of those killed, in some cases coming under fire by Turkish border guards as they approached the bodies. One of the men, a security guard working in one of the local displaced persons camps, filmed a number of the victims and bodies.



Below is a summary of the seven incidents, in reverse chronological order. Human Rights Watch has a record of the names of all the victims and witnesses, but has not used them to help protect them and their relatives from possible retaliation should they reach Turkey. Victims who appear in the video are given pseudonyms. Other victims are not identified.



Human Rights Watch staff and a Syrian assistant and interpreter with close knowledge of the border areas and communities living there interviewed victims, witnesses, and local Syrians by cell phone. Staff explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.



Turkish border guards shoot dead two adults and shoot and injure two adults and two children near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, April 17

Human Rights Watch spoke with four people about the killing of two adults, and wounding of two adults and two children near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on April 17. A survivor of the shooting described in an April 20 interview by cell phone how he witnessed the deaths of his sister and cousin, called “Abdullah,” and how he and the other three were injured. A second brother of the dead woman confirmed her death, and two local men described helping two adults with one injured child leave the area and then retrieving the two bodies.



The man, who returned to his home area near Aleppo, described what happened:

After airstrikes destroyed many homes near where we lived next to Aleppo, 20 people in my family tried to flee to Turkey at the end of March, but the border guards at the Bab al-Salameh crossing would not let us through. The camp there was full, so we went to Khurbat al-Juz and found a smuggler to help us cross.

On Sunday, April 17, a smuggler took us at about 5 p.m. towards the border wall. Suddenly, when we were about 500 meters from the wall, we heard automatic weapons fired from the direction of the wall and bullets landed all around us. The women started screaming and the children started crying, but the shooting continued. We all threw ourselves onto the ground, covering the children. I was lying close to my sister and my cousin, and the bullets hit them while we were lying down. They stopped screaming and shouting. I knew right away they had been killed.

A bullet also hit my right hand. My other cousin was also injured in his right hand. They also shot and injured his 9-year-old daughter in both her legs and his 5-year-old son in his right leg. I saw it happen.

The shooting lasted a long time. I can’t remember for how long, but I think it was at an hour. We were all petrified. Then the shooting just stopped. We waited for a short while. We were all split up in different places. Some of us crawled back towards Khurbat al-Juz. While we were crawling we heard some more shooting. I was near my mother and I think one of the bullets landed near her head and she fainted. We had to leave her to get help. When we felt we were safe, we got up and walked the rest of the way. It took us a long time. I think we reached the village at 8 p.m. Someone found us and took us to a clinic there. My cousin and his children were missing and so was my mother and one of my brother’s children. I didn’t stay in the clinic. I went back with four local men to find the others and to get the bodies of my sister and cousin.

As we approached the place where the bodies were, the Turkish police [sic] started shooting again. The villagers called the police and asked them to stop shooting while we got the bodies. We walked back towards the bodies and this time they didn’t shoot. One of the police spoke to us from the wall using a loudspeaker. He said we had 15 minutes to move the bodies, after which they would start to shoot again. We picked up the bodies and carried them away from the wall as fast as we could. We rested when we were far away. It took us an hour to get them back to the village. We put the bodies in a local man’s house. Later next morning, we buried them in the local cemetery. My sister and cousin both had bullet holes in their back. My cousin also had two bullet holes in his right hand. We all left Khurbat al-Juz at 4 p.m. the same day and went to stay with relatives near Aleppo. That’s where we are now and we won’t try and go back to Turkey. It’s too dangerous.

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with two local men from Khurbat al-Juz who described how, during the early evening of April 17, they helped some of the survivors, including a man with an injured hand and his injured daughter who had been shot in both legs, leave the border area and reach Khurbat al-Juz and then went back with other locals to retrieve the two bodies. They said they found the bodies a few hundred meters from the border wall on the Syrian side, between two Turkish border guard towers near Turkey’s Nişrin and Kandıl police stations. They said the area was very close to the Sheikh Sayyah displaced persons camp on the Syrian side of the border, about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing.



They said Turkish police shot at their car as they approached the bodies. One described what happened next:

We reversed and drove south to the Khurbat al-Juz crossing point. We spoke to a Turkish border guard there and told them we were trying to recover two bodies near the border wall. He called the commander in charge of the nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base. I told him on the phone that there were dead and possibly some injured people on the Syrian side of the wall near Kandıl. He said we could go get the bodies, but should keep the car lights on. Then we drove back. I stayed at the car while the other four walked towards the bodies. They came back and said they had heard soldiers cocking automatic weapons so I drove back again to speak with the commander who said he would drive to the spot on the Turkish side of the body to make sure his men didn’t shoot at us.

I drove back to the area and walked with the others towards the bodies. We could see the commander on the other side holding a torch. We picked up the two bodies – a man and a woman – and took them back to the car and then to Khurbat al-Juz.

When we got back, I spoke to the brother and male cousin of the dead woman and man. I also spoke to the four people who had been shot and injured: the two men with injured hands and the two children hit in the legs. There were other children too who were not injured. Everyone in the group was from the same family. They said there were 10 adults and 10 children in the group, but apart from the two dead, there were two others missing: an older woman and a 6-year-old girl. I got permission from the Turkish commander to look for them the next morning and found them at about 9 a.m. near the border wall. They had stayed there all night in the dark, afraid of being shot.

Then we buried the bodies and the family left to go back to Aleppo.

Turkish border guards shoot dead a 15-year-old boy, on the night of April 14-15

On April 15, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with the two cousins of a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Turkish border guards the night of April 14-15, near the Syrian town of al-Duriya.



The dead boy’s 13-year-old cousin, who witnessed the killing, described what happened:

There were seven of us: three from Duriya, including my cousin, and four from Aleppo. We crossed the border last night near Duriya. We were in a valley called al-Nabua. I am not sure whether we were yet in Turkey, but suddenly the shooting started. My cousin fell down. He was shot in the head. I was next to him. There were bullets flying all around us. We threw ourselves on the ground. A few hours later the shooting stopped and we escaped. A few hours after that we went back to get the body.

On April 15, the dead boy’s other teenage cousin described by cell phone how they retrieved the body:

A few hours ago my brother called me to say Turkish border guards had shot dead our cousin. He asked me to help them bring the body back. He told me where they were and I went with two other friends. As we approached the group we heard shooting and we knew it was the Turkish border guards. We called the mayor of Karbeyaz [a Turkish border town] and asked him to tell the soldiers to stop shooting. He gave us a number for the border guard’s commander and one of the others called him. First he put the phone down. The second time he said, “Anyone who approaches the border will be killed.” The third time he gave us permission to get the body. That was at about 8 a.m. I went with my cousin and the Turkish border guards were waiting for us there. They let us take the body away.

Turkish border guards assault two men near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on April 7

On April 18, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone to a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who helped look after two men who told him Turkish border police had stopped them as they tried to cross into Turkey and assaulted them. He said:

Mid-morning on April 7, I got a call from a[n] [opposition] fighter at one of the Ahrar al-Shams checkpoints in Khurbat al-Juz. He said that two men had tried to cross to Turkey, but were badly beaten by the Turkish border police who had then left them back on the Syrian side of the border wall. He said the two men had walked to the check point and explained what had happened to them. I went to the checkpoint and I met the two men there in a small room. I spoke to them and filmed them.

One of them, called “Badri,” was from Homs and the other, called “Burhan,” was from Hama. Both of them are now back in Idlib province. They told me they had tried to cross to Turkey at al-Maklah, near the first Turkish border guard watch tower about 500 meters south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing point, but that Turkish border guards had caught them and then beaten them really badly. They also said there was a third man with them who the border guards also beat, but we never found out what happened to him.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure two men and young girl near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 29

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a man who was shot by Turkish border police and who also witnessed the shooting and wounding of another man and a young girl called “Elham” as they were heading to Turkey on March 29, near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. He said:

On March 29, at about 6 a.m. I was on my way to Antakya because I needed surgery on a broken hand. I had screws in the hand and I needed them taken out. I crossed the border with a smuggler in a group of 20, including my cousin and a woman from Deir al-Zor together with a little girl. We crossed about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. At the time there was no wall there. There is now. We crossed through a hole in the fence.

The smuggler told us he had a permit for all of us to enter Turkey. A few hundred meters into Turkey a border guard found us. I remember he was fat and fair-haired. He was standing about 10 meters from us when he told us to stop. The smuggler said to him in Arabic, “I have a permit” and the guard just raised his rifle and shot at us. Everyone started running. The bullets hit me in the back and they hit my cousin in the chest. It didn’t hit my spine but just a little to the right of the spine. One of the bullets also hit my bag. The little girl was hit in her leg. Everyone who wasn’t injured, apart from the woman, ran away. The soldier took my phone and then just told us to go back to Syria. My cousin was able to stand and walk and the woman helped me and the little girl walk.

We crept back through the hole in the fence and walked back towards Khurbat al-Juz. Suddenly we heard lots more shooting behind us and we hid for a half an hour without moving. Then the shooting stopped and we continued. From there we went to Ain Beyda clinic. My cousin was transferred to Darkush hospital. The hospital tried to get him to Turkey, but the soldiers at the gate told the hospital that no one is allowed across, even with very serious injuries. Some people in Khurbat al-Juz also described to the soldiers my injuries and asked if I could cross to Turkey for treatment, but they said no.

Turkish border guards beat smuggler to death and assault four men near Ain al-Kawakh near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 28

Human Rights Watch spoke with five people about the killing of one smuggler, called “Faisal,” and injuring of four others near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on March 28. They include one of the men who was beaten, who also witnessed the severe beating of the other four men and three local men from Khurbat al-Juz who recovered the dead smugglers’ body near the Syrian border village of Ain al-Kawakh and the Turkish police station of Nişrin, two to three kilometers north of Khurbat al-Juz and spoke with two of the assaulted men about what had happened.



On April 19, one of the assaulted men called “Ghassan,” who was later filmed by a local man from Khurbat al-Juz, described by cell phone what had happened to him and the other four men:

I am from the Kurdish mountains [Jebel el Ekrad] and am married with two children, aged three years and six months. All five of us fled fighting about 10 months ago. We went to Ikbane village for seven months, but then the regime attacked us in early February, so we went to the Ubeen [displaced persons] camp, but then the regime shelled the camp. I thought about going to Turkey, but I didn’t want to risk my children’s safety crossing with a smuggler. Everyone told me that the Turkish police were shooting at people.

So we went to live in the Salaheddin [displaced persons] camp in Khurbat al-Juz. But we had no money, so I decided to go to Turkey to find work. I found a smuggler and crossed with him and three other men towards the end of March. All four of them lived in the camp too, but I only knew the smuggler.

Just after we had crossed at about 5 a.m., we heard shooting close by. We lay down and shouted, “Don’t shoot.” Then the Turkish border guards arrived. They beat all of us and then they took us to a [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base very close by. As soon as we got there, about six border guards beat us really badly for a long time. They beat me all over my body and on my head. They used their fists and feet and sticks and rifle butts. I have no idea why they beat us. They didn’t say anything in Arabic. They were just shouting in Turkish, but all I really heard was the beating. I was in so much pain I lost track of what has happening. Then I passed out.

I woke up lying on the ground next to the wall on the border, on the Syrian side. It was late morning. I felt very sick and my whole body hurt a lot. A little further away I saw one of the other men from my group. He was lying on the ground and he was moaning for help. I got up and walked towards Khurbat al-Juz to get help for the other man. I met someone and told them where he was. Later that man told me they had found the smuggler’s body near the border wall. It’s better to die in Syria than to die under torture at the border.

On April 20, Human Rights Watch also spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who described how he met one of the other men, called “Hasim,” who had been beaten and whom he filmed speaking about what happened:

It was at the end of March, the same day we found the smuggler’s body. I was near the border and I saw a man walking slowly towards me from the border. He was stumbling and he was covered in blood. I went towards him and he said the Turkish border police had captured him and four other men. I took him to the nearby Ain Beyda clinic in my car.

In the car the man told me what had happened. He said he was a Turkmen from near Aleppo and had escaped the fighting there. He said he tried to go to Turkey with four others, but that the Turkish border guards had caught them and taken them all to a nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing. He said there the border police stripped them and beat them all very badly. He said that the other four all lost consciousness but he didn’t and that they took him in a pickup truck to the border wall and let him go.

On April 18 and 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with three locals from Khurbat al-Juz about how they recovered the body of the smuggler. All three of them described how Turkish border guards on a jeep repeatedly shot at them as they tried to approach the body lying a few hundred meters from the border wall, even though they had asked the local Turkish border guards for permission first.



Turkish border guards shoot dead smuggler near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, around March 20

Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who found the body of a smuggler called “Ibrahim” right next to the border wall close to the Salaheddin displaced persons camp in Khurbat al-Juz, around March 20. He said:

On the third Friday of March, people in the Salaheddin camp nearby told me there was a body next to the border wall near the camp. I called the Güveççi mayor and asked him to tell the border guards not to shoot us while we went to get the body. He said OK, so we went to the body and they didn’t shoot at us. The man was lying on the ground right by the wall near a gap in the wall where there are usually Turkish border police on the other side. He had a gunshot wound in the middle of his chest. I recognized the man because he was living in the Salaheddin camp before.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure man near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, first week of March

On April 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed a man by cell phone who was shot in the leg as he tried to cross to Turkey during the first week of March. He said:

I am from Jisr al-Shughur. I fled with my family because of the regime attacks on the town in February and March. We first tried to go to one of the [displaced persons] camps between Ain Beida and Khurbat al-Juz, but life there was very tough. So my wife and I decided to try to go to Turkey with our children.

About 35 days ago at eight in the evening we tried to cross in a group of about 13 in an area about two kilometers south of Khurbat al-Juz. There were about six men, four women, and three children in our group. A smuggler organized it but didn’t come with us. He sent two young boys, about 12 and 13, to help us cross. We approached the fence and suddenly we heard shooting. I felt pain in my leg and saw I was hit in the leg. I fell down. Everyone else ran away. I stayed in that place for about 30 minutes and I shouted for help. No one else was injured. The shooting stopped and then some men came and carried me back to Khurbat al-Juz. There was no shooting while they were helping me. They took me to Ain Beida hospital two or three kilometers away. The doctors told me I had one bullet above my knee and one bullet below my knee, in the left leg."

A Bulgarian border police patrol on March 23 found the dead bodies of two men -- presumed to be migrants -- in a region close to the country's border with Turkey, authorities said.Border police spokeswoman Lora Lyubenova told AFP that the men, found in the Malko Tarnovo region, had no documents and so could not be identified.""Their probable age could not be determined as the bodies were found in a state of decomposition. There were no immediate signs of violence,"" she added.She said it was not possible to determine whether they were migrants, saying only that there was ""increased migration pressure along the Bulgarian-Turkish border"".Two female migrants froze to death in the same region in February and the bodies of two other men were found in a mountainous area at Bulgaria's western border with Serbia in January.EU member Bulgaria has so far remained on the sidelines of the major migrant flow from Turkey and Greece through the Balkans to northern Europe.But it has accelerated the construction of a fence along its Turkish border after western Balkan countries closed their borders earlier this year."

4Mi is the Mixed Migration Centre’s flagship primary data collection system, an innovative approach that helps fill knowledge gaps, and inform policy and response regarding the nature of mixed migratory movements and the protection risks for migrants on the move. It is a regular, standardized, quantitative and globalized system, with a network of more than 120 field enumerators who are conducting survey interviews with migrants on the move in around 15 countries at any one point in time.

In-depth survey interviews with migrants

4Mi has a unique network of field enumerators situated along frequently used mixed migration routes and in major migratory hubs. Our enumerators use a standard in-depth survey to conduct more than 1,000 4Mi interviews per month with migrants who have recently arrived in a location or are still on the move. MMC has conducted more than 125,000 surveys since 4Mi began in 2014.

Through 4Mi, MMC places those on the move and what they say at the heart of our understanding of the mixed migration phenomenon, and the 4Mi approach enables MMC to gather extensive and timely data relating to individual profiles, drivers of migration, experiences and decision-making along the journey, interactions with smugglers, and aspirations and destination choices.

The Turkish authorities should stop pushing Syrian asylum seekers back at the border and should investigate all use of excessive force by border guards.

During March and April 2016, Turkish border guards used violence against Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers, killing five people, including a child, and seriously injuring 14 others, according to victims, witnesses, and Syrian locals interviewed by Human Rights Watch. Turkey’s Foreign Affairs Ministry maintains the country has an “open-door policy” for Syrian refugees, despite building a new border wall.



“While senior Turkish officials claim they are welcoming Syrian refugees with open borders and open arms, their border guards are killing and beating them,” said Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Firing at traumatized men, women, and children fleeing fighting and indiscriminate warfare is truly appalling.”



Since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards have pushed back Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April 2016, Human Rights Watch reported that Turkish border guards enforcing Turkey’s one-year-old border closure had shot at Syrians escaping advances by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), northeast of Aleppo. Human Rights Watch also revealed how Turkish border guards blocked thousands of fleeing displaced persons after their camps near the border had been hit by artillery fire on April 13 and 15.

The hostilities continue to threaten Syrians already displaced by fighting. According to witnesses, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, three airstrikes hit the Kamuna camp sheltering 4,500 displaced Syrians near Sarmada in northern Idlib province, five kilometers from Turkey’s increasingly impenetrable border. An independent humanitarian source in Turkey told Human Rights Watch that medics recovered 20 bodies, including two children, and that at least 37 people were injured, including 10 who lost one or more limbs and who were transferred to Turkey for medical care.



According to the Syrian Civil Defense, seven women and four children were also injured on April 24, when three artillery rounds fired by Syrian government forces hit al-Iqaa displaced persons camp near al-Zawf, located six kilometers northeast of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing. According to camp representatives, the al-Iqaa camp shelters many Syrians who have previously been pushed back by Turkish border guards.

Human Rights Watch interviewed victims and witnesses involved in seven incidents between the first week of March and April 17, in which Turkish border guards shot dead three asylum seekers (one man, one woman, and a 15-year-old boy) and one smuggler; beat to death one smuggler; shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three children, aged 3, 5, and 9; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers. Syrians living near the border also described the aftermaths of the shootings and beatings, including Turkish border guards firing at them as they tried to recover bodies at the border wall. One witness filmed a number of the dead and surviving victims and shared the videos with Human Rights Watch.



On May 4, Human Rights Watch sent a letter with these findings to the Turkish interior minister, urging Turkey to investigate the allegations made by Human Rights Watch, to order its guards not to shoot at asylum seekers, and to re-open its border to Syrians seeking safety.



Six of the incidents Syrian witnesses described took place near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, about 50 kilometers south of the Turkish city of Antakya. The seventh happened near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya. Seven of the injured people said they had briefly stayed in the Salaheddin camp for displaced persons in the village of Khurbat al-Juz, overlooking the newly-erected Turkish border wall nearby. Most of them, and others who traveled straight to the border, said they had recently fled fighting in and around Aleppo.





Between April 12 and 20, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 28 other Syrian asylum seekers who described Turkish border guards intercepting them as they crossed the border with smugglers between February and mid-April. They said guards detained them for up to a day, then pushed them back to Syria with dozens – and in some cases hundreds – of others. Some were living in the Khirmash IDP camp to the west of the Syrian town of Bidama. A representative of the camp told Human Rights Watch that on April 13, Turkish border guards in the nearby watchtowers used loudspeakers to announce in Arabic that no one should approach the border and that anyone who did would be shot.



Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by land army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since such specific information was not provided or known by many witnesses.



As of early April, Turkey had completed a third of its 911-kilometer rocket-resistant concrete wall along its border with Syria and was working to fortify the rest of its border.



Turkey is entitled to secure its border with Syria, but is obliged to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits rejecting asylum seekers at borders when that would expose them to the threat of persecution, torture, and threats to life and freedom. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity, including the absolute prohibition on subjecting anyone to inhuman and degrading treatment.

The violence against Syrian refugees, and Turkey’s refusal to allow them to cross the border, comes as the European Union has shut its own borders to asylum seekers. In March, the EU concluded a controversial migration deal with Ankara to curb refugee and migration flows to Europe, committing €6 billion in aid to assist Syrians in Turkey, reinvigorating Turkey’s EU membership negotiations, and offering the prospect of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal provides for Europe to return migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, including Syrians, who reach Greece by boat, on the grounds that Turkey is a safe country for them. The deal also commits the EU to work with Turkey to create areas inside Syria that will be “more safe.”



“The EU shouldn’t just stand by and watch as Turkey uses live ammunition and rifle butts to stem the refugee flow,” said Simpson. “EU officials should recognize that their red light for refugees to enter the EU gives Turkey a green light to close its border, exacting a heavy price on war-ravaged asylum seekers with nowhere else to go.”



Turkish border guard violence against Syrian refugees

In mid-April 2016, Human Rights Watch interviewed four victims, five witnesses, and six local Syrian residents who described seven occasions in March and April in which Turkish border guards shot or assaulted 17 Syrian asylum seekers and two smugglers. During the incidents, Turkish border guards killed five people (shot to death three asylum seekers and a smuggler and beat to death one smuggler); shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three young children; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers.



Six of the incidents occurred near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, near the Turkish town of Antakya, and one near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya.



Human Rights Watch also interviewed six Syrians from Khurbat al-Juz who helped some of the survivors and retrieved the bodies of those killed, in some cases coming under fire by Turkish border guards as they approached the bodies. One of the men, a security guard working in one of the local displaced persons camps, filmed a number of the victims and bodies.



Below is a summary of the seven incidents, in reverse chronological order. Human Rights Watch has a record of the names of all the victims and witnesses, but has not used them to help protect them and their relatives from possible retaliation should they reach Turkey. Victims who appear in the video are given pseudonyms. Other victims are not identified.



Human Rights Watch staff and a Syrian assistant and interpreter with close knowledge of the border areas and communities living there interviewed victims, witnesses, and local Syrians by cell phone. Staff explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.



Turkish border guards shoot dead two adults and shoot and injure two adults and two children near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, April 17

Human Rights Watch spoke with four people about the killing of two adults, and wounding of two adults and two children near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on April 17. A survivor of the shooting described in an April 20 interview by cell phone how he witnessed the deaths of his sister and cousin, called “Abdullah,” and how he and the other three were injured. A second brother of the dead woman confirmed her death, and two local men described helping two adults with one injured child leave the area and then retrieving the two bodies.



The man, who returned to his home area near Aleppo, described what happened:

After airstrikes destroyed many homes near where we lived next to Aleppo, 20 people in my family tried to flee to Turkey at the end of March, but the border guards at the Bab al-Salameh crossing would not let us through. The camp there was full, so we went to Khurbat al-Juz and found a smuggler to help us cross.

On Sunday, April 17, a smuggler took us at about 5 p.m. towards the border wall. Suddenly, when we were about 500 meters from the wall, we heard automatic weapons fired from the direction of the wall and bullets landed all around us. The women started screaming and the children started crying, but the shooting continued. We all threw ourselves onto the ground, covering the children. I was lying close to my sister and my cousin, and the bullets hit them while we were lying down. They stopped screaming and shouting. I knew right away they had been killed.

A bullet also hit my right hand. My other cousin was also injured in his right hand. They also shot and injured his 9-year-old daughter in both her legs and his 5-year-old son in his right leg. I saw it happen.

The shooting lasted a long time. I can’t remember for how long, but I think it was at an hour. We were all petrified. Then the shooting just stopped. We waited for a short while. We were all split up in different places. Some of us crawled back towards Khurbat al-Juz. While we were crawling we heard some more shooting. I was near my mother and I think one of the bullets landed near her head and she fainted. We had to leave her to get help. When we felt we were safe, we got up and walked the rest of the way. It took us a long time. I think we reached the village at 8 p.m. Someone found us and took us to a clinic there. My cousin and his children were missing and so was my mother and one of my brother’s children. I didn’t stay in the clinic. I went back with four local men to find the others and to get the bodies of my sister and cousin.

As we approached the place where the bodies were, the Turkish police [sic] started shooting again. The villagers called the police and asked them to stop shooting while we got the bodies. We walked back towards the bodies and this time they didn’t shoot. One of the police spoke to us from the wall using a loudspeaker. He said we had 15 minutes to move the bodies, after which they would start to shoot again. We picked up the bodies and carried them away from the wall as fast as we could. We rested when we were far away. It took us an hour to get them back to the village. We put the bodies in a local man’s house. Later next morning, we buried them in the local cemetery. My sister and cousin both had bullet holes in their back. My cousin also had two bullet holes in his right hand. We all left Khurbat al-Juz at 4 p.m. the same day and went to stay with relatives near Aleppo. That’s where we are now and we won’t try and go back to Turkey. It’s too dangerous.

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with two local men from Khurbat al-Juz who described how, during the early evening of April 17, they helped some of the survivors, including a man with an injured hand and his injured daughter who had been shot in both legs, leave the border area and reach Khurbat al-Juz and then went back with other locals to retrieve the two bodies. They said they found the bodies a few hundred meters from the border wall on the Syrian side, between two Turkish border guard towers near Turkey’s Nişrin and Kandıl police stations. They said the area was very close to the Sheikh Sayyah displaced persons camp on the Syrian side of the border, about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing.



They said Turkish police shot at their car as they approached the bodies. One described what happened next:

We reversed and drove south to the Khurbat al-Juz crossing point. We spoke to a Turkish border guard there and told them we were trying to recover two bodies near the border wall. He called the commander in charge of the nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base. I told him on the phone that there were dead and possibly some injured people on the Syrian side of the wall near Kandıl. He said we could go get the bodies, but should keep the car lights on. Then we drove back. I stayed at the car while the other four walked towards the bodies. They came back and said they had heard soldiers cocking automatic weapons so I drove back again to speak with the commander who said he would drive to the spot on the Turkish side of the body to make sure his men didn’t shoot at us.

I drove back to the area and walked with the others towards the bodies. We could see the commander on the other side holding a torch. We picked up the two bodies – a man and a woman – and took them back to the car and then to Khurbat al-Juz.

When we got back, I spoke to the brother and male cousin of the dead woman and man. I also spoke to the four people who had been shot and injured: the two men with injured hands and the two children hit in the legs. There were other children too who were not injured. Everyone in the group was from the same family. They said there were 10 adults and 10 children in the group, but apart from the two dead, there were two others missing: an older woman and a 6-year-old girl. I got permission from the Turkish commander to look for them the next morning and found them at about 9 a.m. near the border wall. They had stayed there all night in the dark, afraid of being shot.

Then we buried the bodies and the family left to go back to Aleppo.

Turkish border guards shoot dead a 15-year-old boy, on the night of April 14-15

On April 15, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with the two cousins of a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Turkish border guards the night of April 14-15, near the Syrian town of al-Duriya.



The dead boy’s 13-year-old cousin, who witnessed the killing, described what happened:

There were seven of us: three from Duriya, including my cousin, and four from Aleppo. We crossed the border last night near Duriya. We were in a valley called al-Nabua. I am not sure whether we were yet in Turkey, but suddenly the shooting started. My cousin fell down. He was shot in the head. I was next to him. There were bullets flying all around us. We threw ourselves on the ground. A few hours later the shooting stopped and we escaped. A few hours after that we went back to get the body.

On April 15, the dead boy’s other teenage cousin described by cell phone how they retrieved the body:

A few hours ago my brother called me to say Turkish border guards had shot dead our cousin. He asked me to help them bring the body back. He told me where they were and I went with two other friends. As we approached the group we heard shooting and we knew it was the Turkish border guards. We called the mayor of Karbeyaz [a Turkish border town] and asked him to tell the soldiers to stop shooting. He gave us a number for the border guard’s commander and one of the others called him. First he put the phone down. The second time he said, “Anyone who approaches the border will be killed.” The third time he gave us permission to get the body. That was at about 8 a.m. I went with my cousin and the Turkish border guards were waiting for us there. They let us take the body away.

Turkish border guards assault two men near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on April 7

On April 18, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone to a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who helped look after two men who told him Turkish border police had stopped them as they tried to cross into Turkey and assaulted them. He said:

Mid-morning on April 7, I got a call from a[n] [opposition] fighter at one of the Ahrar al-Shams checkpoints in Khurbat al-Juz. He said that two men had tried to cross to Turkey, but were badly beaten by the Turkish border police who had then left them back on the Syrian side of the border wall. He said the two men had walked to the check point and explained what had happened to them. I went to the checkpoint and I met the two men there in a small room. I spoke to them and filmed them.

One of them, called “Badri,” was from Homs and the other, called “Burhan,” was from Hama. Both of them are now back in Idlib province. They told me they had tried to cross to Turkey at al-Maklah, near the first Turkish border guard watch tower about 500 meters south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing point, but that Turkish border guards had caught them and then beaten them really badly. They also said there was a third man with them who the border guards also beat, but we never found out what happened to him.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure two men and young girl near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 29

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a man who was shot by Turkish border police and who also witnessed the shooting and wounding of another man and a young girl called “Elham” as they were heading to Turkey on March 29, near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. He said:

On March 29, at about 6 a.m. I was on my way to Antakya because I needed surgery on a broken hand. I had screws in the hand and I needed them taken out. I crossed the border with a smuggler in a group of 20, including my cousin and a woman from Deir al-Zor together with a little girl. We crossed about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. At the time there was no wall there. There is now. We crossed through a hole in the fence.

The smuggler told us he had a permit for all of us to enter Turkey. A few hundred meters into Turkey a border guard found us. I remember he was fat and fair-haired. He was standing about 10 meters from us when he told us to stop. The smuggler said to him in Arabic, “I have a permit” and the guard just raised his rifle and shot at us. Everyone started running. The bullets hit me in the back and they hit my cousin in the chest. It didn’t hit my spine but just a little to the right of the spine. One of the bullets also hit my bag. The little girl was hit in her leg. Everyone who wasn’t injured, apart from the woman, ran away. The soldier took my phone and then just told us to go back to Syria. My cousin was able to stand and walk and the woman helped me and the little girl walk.

We crept back through the hole in the fence and walked back towards Khurbat al-Juz. Suddenly we heard lots more shooting behind us and we hid for a half an hour without moving. Then the shooting stopped and we continued. From there we went to Ain Beyda clinic. My cousin was transferred to Darkush hospital. The hospital tried to get him to Turkey, but the soldiers at the gate told the hospital that no one is allowed across, even with very serious injuries.

Turkish border guards beat smuggler to death and assault four men near Ain al-Kawakh near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 28

Human Rights Watch spoke with five people about the killing of one smuggler, called “Faisal,” and injuring of four others near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on March 28. They include one of the men who was beaten, who also witnessed the severe beating of the other four men and three local men from Khurbat al-Juz who recovered the dead smugglers’ body near the Syrian border village of Ain al-Kawakh and the Turkish police station of Nişrin, two to three kilometers north of Khurbat al-Juz and spoke with two of the assaulted men about what had happened.



On April 19, one of the assaulted men called “Ghassan,” who was later filmed by a local man from Khurbat al-Juz, described by cell phone what had happened to him and the other four men:

I am from the Kurdish mountains [Jebel el Ekrad] and am married with two children, aged three years and six months. All five of us fled fighting about 10 months ago. We went to Ikbane village for seven months, but then the regime attacked us in early February, so we went to the Ubeen [displaced persons] camp, but then the regime shelled the camp. I thought about going to Turkey, but I didn’t want to risk my children’s safety crossing with a smuggler. Everyone told me that the Turkish police were shooting at people.

So we went to live in the Salaheddin [displaced persons] camp in Khurbat al-Juz. But we had no money, so I decided to go to Turkey to find work. I found a smuggler and crossed with him and three other men towards the end of March. All four of them lived in the camp too, but I only knew the smuggler.

Just after we had crossed at about 5 a.m., we heard shooting close by. We lay down and shouted, “Don’t shoot.” Then the Turkish border guards arrived. They beat all of us and then they took us to a [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base very close by. As soon as we got there, about six border guards beat us really badly for a long time. They beat me all over my body and on my head. They used their fists and feet and sticks and rifle butts. I have no idea why they beat us. They didn’t say anything in Arabic. They were just shouting in Turkish, but all I really heard was the beating. I was in so much pain I lost track of what has happening. Then I passed out.

I woke up lying on the ground next to the wall on the border, on the Syrian side. It was late morning. I felt very sick and my whole body hurt a lot. A little further away I saw one of the other men from my group. He was lying on the ground and he was moaning for help. I got up and walked towards Khurbat al-Juz to get help for the other man. I met someone and told them where he was. Later that man told me they had found the smuggler’s body near the border wall. It’s better to die in Syria than to die under torture at the border.

On April 20, Human Rights Watch also spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who described how he met one of the other men, called “Hasim,” who had been beaten and whom he filmed speaking about what happened:

It was at the end of March, the same day we found the smuggler’s body. I was near the border and I saw a man walking slowly towards me from the border. He was stumbling and he was covered in blood. I went towards him and he said the Turkish border police had captured him and four other men. I took him to the nearby Ain Beyda clinic in my car.

In the car the man told me what had happened. He said he was a Turkmen from near Aleppo and had escaped the fighting there. He said he tried to go to Turkey with four others, but that the Turkish border guards had caught them and taken them all to a nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing. He said there the border police stripped them and beat them all very badly. He said that the other four all lost consciousness but he didn’t and that they took him in a pickup truck to the border wall and let him go.

On April 18 and 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with three locals from Khurbat al-Juz about how they recovered the body of the smuggler. All three of them described how Turkish border guards on a jeep repeatedly shot at them as they tried to approach the body lying a few hundred meters from the border wall, even though they had asked the local Turkish border guards for permission first.



Turkish border guards shoot dead smuggler near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, around March 20

Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who found the body of a smuggler called “Ibrahim” right next to the border wall close to the Salaheddin displaced persons camp in Khurbat al-Juz, around March 20. He said:

On the third Friday of March, people in the Salaheddin camp nearby told me there was a body next to the border wall near the camp. I called the Güveççi mayor and asked him to tell the border guards not to shoot us while we went to get the body. He said OK, so we went to the body and they didn’t shoot at us. The man was lying on the ground right by the wall near a gap in the wall where there are usually Turkish border police on the other side. He had a gunshot wound in the middle of his chest. I recognized the man because he was living in the Salaheddin camp before.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure man near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, first week of March

On April 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed a man by cell phone who was shot in the leg as he tried to cross to Turkey during the first week of March. He said:

I am from Jisr al-Shughur. I fled with my family because of the regime attacks on the town in February and March. We first tried to go to one of the [displaced persons] camps between Ain Beida and Khurbat al-Juz, but life there was very tough. So my wife and I decided to try to go to Turkey with our children.

About 35 days ago at eight in the evening we tried to cross in a group of about 13 in an area about two kilometers south of Khurbat al-Juz. There were about six men, four women, and three children in our group. A smuggler organized it but didn’t come with us. He sent two young boys, about 12 and 13, to help us cross. We approached the fence and suddenly we heard shooting. I felt pain in my leg and saw I was hit in the leg. I fell down. Everyone else ran away. I stayed in that place for about 30 minutes and I shouted for help. No one else was injured. The shooting stopped and then some men came and carried me back to Khurbat al-Juz. There was no shooting while they were helping me. They took me to Ain Beida hospital two or three kilometers away. The doctors told me I had one bullet above my knee and one bullet below my knee, in the left leg."

Mohammed Hussain, 18, was clinging to the underside of a lorry when the vehicle crashed at around 6pm on Friday night. The teenager appears to have had a legitimate claim for entry to the UK.

Friends of Hussain’s, speaking from the camp at Dunkirk where the teenager had spent six months, revealed that he had family members living in Manchester – whom he was trying to reach – making him eligible to claim asylum in the UK under the EU’s Dublin regulation, which promotes family reunification.

The friends accused the Home Office of being responsible for the Hussain’s death, and said charities at the camp had not seen any evidence of British government officials visiting Dunkirk and Calais to assess and register how many refugees were eligible to claim asylum in the UK.

Maddie Harris of the charity Help Refugees, who knew Hussain’s cousin in the camp in northern France, said: “He was trying to find a better life and died in the process and our government is responsible for his death.”

She said police officers in Oxfordshire had called Hussain’s cousin on Friday evening to reveal details of the tragedy.

In a separate incident, an 11-year-old boy from Afghanistan has gone missing after being spotted climbing on to a ferry to Dover on Wednesday morning.

Liz Clegg, who runs the women and children’s centre in Calais and looks after scores of unaccompanied minors, said she had tried to contact the youngster, called Kareem, but to no avail. She also said she had contacted Kent police, but they allegedly refused to issue a missing persons report.

She said Kareem was an unaccompanied minor, who had been living in her centre at the Calais refugee camp for at least six months.

Clegg said: “The officer said that he did not go missing from Kent and my reply was that I am 99.9% certain that he is in Kent. I kept saying it’s an emergency, he’s 11 and doesn’t speak English, but it was a very unhelpful response.

“So they then alerted French police hoping that between them they might generate a missing child alert. From our experience in the last few days there appears to be no coordinated response in regards to refugee children going missing.

“He is a kind, funny and smart boy all and his friends are deeply concerned and feel powerless to do anything. He has now been missing for days.”

Charities on Saturday urged anyone who had seen the young Afghan to contact Help Refugees.

It is difficult to make an accurate assessment of the number of refugees who die trying to enter Britain, but a Guardian investigation found that at least 15 migrants had died trying to escape Calais in 2014. Such deaths on British soil are rare.

Josie Naughton of Help Refugees said her organisation had ”repeatedly pleaded with the authorities to register the children in the camp. Our warnings about the dangers of not doing so were ignored, with potentially terrible consequences for this young boy.”

George Gabriel of Citizens UK said: “The disappearance of this boy is a grim reminder of the dangers faced by hundreds of children who are alone in Calais and Dunkirk. Our governments should be ashamed that they are not doing more to register and protect unaccompanied minors.”"

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Dec 6 (Reuters) - At around 2 a.m. on Saturday, April 9, a large blue fishing boat carrying hundreds of African migrants and their children capsized just off the coast of Egypt.

Some drowned quickly. Others thrashed in the water, yelling for help in Arabic, Somali or Afan Oromo. The few with lifejackets blew whistles that pierced through the shrieks.

A solitary electric torch probed the moonless darkness. It came from a smaller boat that was circling, tantalisingly close. The men on that boat, the people-smugglers who had brought their human cargo to this point, were searching only for their comrades. They ignored the screams of the migrants and beat some back into the water.

Just 10 migrants managed to scramble up into the smaller boat to join the smugglers and 27 other migrants already aboard.

Around 500 adults and children died on the voyage, according to survivor and official estimates, the largest loss of life in the Mediterranean in 2016.

Among the dead were an estimated 190 Somalis, around 150 Ethiopians, 80 Egyptians, and some 85 people from Sudan, Syria and other countries. Thirty-seven migrants survived.

Awale Sandhool, a 23-year-old who worked at a radio station in Mogadishu and had fled death threats at home, was among the few who swam to safety. Amid the chaos of the sinking, he said, his childhood friend Bilal Milyare had shouted to him from the water before drowning: ""Could we not have been saved?""

Until now, no one has tried to answer that question.

A Reuters investigation in collaboration with BBC Newsnight has found that in the seven months since the mass drowning, no official body, national or multinational, has held anyone to account for the deaths or even opened an inquiry into the shipwreck.

When the news emerged via social media eight days after the sinking, European politicians showed brief interest. Italian President Sergio Mattarella suggested that the world should reflect on ""yet another tragedy in the Mediterranean.""

But Italy, where the ship was headed, has not investigated the sinking. Nor has Greece, where the survivors landed, or Egypt, from where the migrants and smugglers set sail. There has been no investigation by any United Nations body, the European Union's frontier agency, the EU police agency, any maritime agency, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or the EU naval task force in the Mediterranean.

The only significant official action taken so far has been a fraud case against some of the smugglers in Egypt, sparked by complaints to police by a handful of grieving parents. No one has been apprehended in that case.

Reuters has identified the owners of the doomed ship and the ringleaders of the voyage, as well as the people-brokers who assembled the migrants in Cairo and Alexandria and took their money.

The investigation demonstrates the gaps in international law enforcement that make it easy for human smugglers to pursue their deadly trade in the Mediterranean. But it also shows what could be done if authorities chose to make a priority of investigating migrant deaths.

The official indifference to the disaster contrasts with how nations mobilised after EgyptAir Flight MS804 crashed in the Mediterranean on May 19, killing 66 people. Within hours of the crash, Egypt dispatched warships and air force planes to search for wreckage and survivors. France, Britain and the United States sent their own ships and aircraft. An investigation into what caused the crash and who was responsible continues in both Egypt and France.

Rob Wainwright, director of the European police agency, Europol, said that in hindsight his agency should have investigated the April sinking. Reuters inquiries might have exposed a ""gap here in the collective response by Europe"" to such cases, he said in an interview.

He said the news agency's inquiries had ""triggered our minds about how we can improve."" In late November he said that Europol would study evidence collected by Reuters with BBC Newsnight - and would consider opening an inquiry into the case, together with Greece or another member state. ""If we can find a way of expediting it and making it operational then we will try to do that.""

In Egypt, Judge Khaled al-Nashar, assistant to Egypt's Minister of Justice for Parliamentary and Media Affairs, said he could not confirm what inquiries had taken place into the April sinking but further action was not ruled out. ""If the occurrence of such a crime is proven, Egypt certainly will not hesitate to conduct the necessary investigations to uncover it and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.""

Egypt's special ambassador for migration, Naela Jabr, said security agencies were ""doing their utmost"" to fight illegal migration, arresting 5,076 people who tried to migrate illegally in the first six months of the year. Jabr said a people-smuggling law passed by parliament in October and ratified in November would help in the crackdown.

Some Egyptian lawyers said the government already had the power to impose justice in the case. They said that smugglers responsible for the voyage could be prosecuted for first-degree homicide, abetting illegal migration, and maritime safety breaches.

""I consider putting 500 people on this boat to be murder. There is no other way to describe it,"" said Sabry Tolba, an Egyptian lawyer hired by the families of some of those who died.

The November 2000 Palermo Convention against organised crime, signed by all of the nations involved in the tragedy, also requires countries to pass laws, take effective measures and ""cooperate to the fullest extent possible"" to prevent and suppress the smuggling of migrants by sea.

This account is based on interviews with people involved in all aspects of the voyage: survivors, relatives of the victims, smugglers, fishermen, coastal residents in Egypt, security and maritime officials, agents who acted as the middlemen between passengers and traffickers, and money changers who handled the cash. Reuters also analysed social media networks to track the links between smugglers and their human cargo.

Among the obstacles that had to be overcome: Survivors, fearing repatriation to Egypt and retaliation from the smuggler gangs, initially lied about key details of the trip. Those lies, widely repeated by the media and by UN agencies, have helped delay bringing the perpetrators to account.

THE PEOPLE MARKET

In the spring of this year, crowds began gathering every day on Mekka el Mokrama Street in Cairo, where the Egypt headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is located. They were migrants, most of them from Somalia and Ethiopia, queuing to register with UNHCR so they could temporarily but legally live in Egypt.

On the street, brokers circled.

""Italy, Italy, Italy,"" they shouted, as they hawked places on boats headed across the Mediterranean.

Over the winter, few boats had made that trip. But now the weather was clearing and the people-smuggling business was picking up. By August, more than 11,379 migrants would make it to Italy from Egypt, more than in all of 2015. The Mediterranean would prove deadlier than ever. According to the UNHCR, more than 4,663 people have died trying to cross the sea to Europe this year, a record.

One broker touting passage was Hamza Abdirashid, a slim and well-dressed man whose Facebook profile says he comes from the city of Hargeisa in the breakaway part of Somalia known as Somaliland.

Sandhool, the young Somali from Mogadishu, met him in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City, where Somali migrants often congregate. ""He came around in a car and asked me if I wanted to go to Europe,"" Sandhool said.

The price was $1,800, Sandhool said. But ""Hamza was saying if you take five people along, you will get two for free."" Sandhool said he later negotiated a $500 discount for himself with one of Abdirashid's deputies, another Somali in Cairo.

Brokers charged passengers a fee of between $1,300 and $2,500, based on the traveller's ability to pay, according to more than a dozen survivors interviewed. People involved in the business said the broker typically kept $200 of that, passing on the rest to the smugglers.

Several other migrants identified Abdirashid as the main broker for Somalis on the April voyage. Other brokers handled other nationalities. The middlemen usually come from the same ethnic group as the migrants.

The brokers used messaging on apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber to negotiate with migrants. Records of those interactions could help law enforcement identify the brokers. An analysis of the Facebook friends of Abdirashid, the broker, shows he was connected to at least 10 of those Somalis on board the ship: six victims and four survivors.

Contacted on social media, Abdirashid declined to comment about his role as a broker, saying that the issue of illegal migration was sensitive.

""I'm a student, I don't want to face problems,"" he wrote in a WhatsApp conversation with a reporter.

GOING DOWN

In the evening of Thursday, April 7, a fleet of minibuses moved through the suburbs of Cairo, picking up Somalis and Ethiopians from lay-bys and street corners.

The buses were tourist vehicles, hired from a Giza-based company called Honest Tours, said one broker. Emad Monir, transport director of the company, said he was unaware of this trip or any other involving illegal migrants. ""It is like stopping a taxi on the street, the driver doesn't ask the client why is he going to the place.""

The buses carried the migrants for three hours to the port city of Alexandria.

Sandhool and his fellow travellers were handed to another group of Egyptian smugglers who would earn around $220 a head. For that, the smugglers put migrants temporarily in takhzeen, or storage - apartment buildings in Alexandria or isolated compounds close to the shore. They also took care of el Nazla, or going down, shifting the migrants into waiting boats.

It was at this stage that the first known deaths occurred.

At dawn on Friday, April 8, after a night waiting in isolated car parks with curtains drawn, a group of Somalis and Ethiopians were offloaded from buses on Alexandria's Miami Beach. The beach is a tourist destination and is typically thronged with pleasure-seekers.

It is also fenced off and usually protected by guards. But no guard was visible that day and nobody intervened when smugglers armed with pistols assembled the migrants into groups of 20 or 30 and loaded them onto hasakas, the small wooden boats with engines that ply this part of the coast.

""Everyone was being grabbed and thrown on. People were sitting on top of me and I felt a lot of pressure,"" said Sandhool. ""Then the boat started moving.""

Within sight of the beach, and well inside Egyptian territorial waters, the hasakas pulled up alongside a small wooden fishing boat with a cover shading its deck. So close to shore, the swell was treacherous. As people struggled out, Sandhool's hasaka began to tip. AbdiAziz Shiyo, a 23-year-from Hargeisa who had played soccer with Sandhool in Cairo, spotted the danger.

""Keep the balance!"" he shouted.

It was too late. The hasaka overturned and tossed everyone in the water. Shiyo drowned, as did Asad Elmi, a pregnant woman in her twenties, and an unrelated six-month-old child. Others, including Sandhool, managed to scramble onto the fishing boat.

Osman Asad Mohamed, a migrant from southern Somalia, also witnessed the deaths. He said smugglers had a spare wooden boat ready to take away the bodies and collect any abandoned luggage.

Abdelaziz Yusuf, a criminal lawyer in Cairo, said Egyptian maritime law required all vessels to carry communication equipment and to call for help in an emergency. If anyone died, Yusuf said, the sailors could be prosecuted either under maritime law, for failure to perform their duties, or under civilian law for deliberate failure to act to save a life when they were able. The latter could be deemed premeditated first-degree murder under Article 230 of the Egyptian penal code, which carries a death penalty.

By now, the wind was picking up and the swell building. Nevertheless, the fishing boat - about 15 metres (50 feet) long, painted white with a blue and gold stripe along its hull - set off with nearly 200 people aboard.

Local sailors identified the boat as one that operated from the small, military-controlled port of Abu Qir further along the coast from Miami Beach. Local fishermen and security officials said smuggling from that port was controlled by Ismail al-Bougy, a powerful 41-year-old who got his start hawking seafood on the street. Bougy's real name, according to the security officials and a police report seen by Reuters, is Ismail Ali.

The wooden fishing boat - or ""middle boat,"" as it became known - was to ferry the migrants to a much larger ship. Survivors would later refer to the main vessel as the ""big boat.""

That big boat was a deep-sea fishing trawler. It was painted blue and measured around 22 metres (72 feet). According to survivors, it had three decks: a top deck exposed to the weather, a main working deck, and a refrigerated fish-hold accessed via a narrow hatch and ladder.

By Friday night, the trawler was stationary offshore, rolling and pitching in growing waves. Instead of fish, the trawler's hold was loaded with more than 300 passengers who had been brought out from other beaches over the previous two days. The smugglers planned to cram another 150 to 200 people into the load.

SHIPS AND SMUGGLERS

Egypt's Mediterranean coast is tightly controlled by the nation's coast guard and military. Large sea-going vessels can only depart from a handful of creeks or Nile branches - all watched by coast guard towers. For this reason, the identities of ships and crew that run smuggling missions become well-known among fishermen and local coast guard officers.

Egypt's coast guard service did not respond to a request to comment.

Local fishermen and other smugglers say the ""big boat"" that sank in April was built in a shipyard and registered at the port of Rashid, the modern name for ancient Rosetta, about 50 km (30 miles) northeast of Alexandria.

One of Egypt's top people-smugglers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified the sunken trawler as the Abu Nawal, registered in Rashid as RSH-123. The smuggler, who is wanted in Italy for allegedly organising other illegal voyages, supplied a set of photographs of the vessel and said he knew about this trip because he was asked to recruit passengers for it but declined.

He said fishing boats were made in Rashid specifically for trafficking. ""Nowadays we make boats to work in this business, not to fish. It is a million times more profitable."" With fishing, the net was often empty. But on a smuggling trip, ""you can make $400,000.""

The Abu Nawal departed Rashid on March 9 to go fishing and has not returned, according to an April 16 coast guard report received by the fisheries ministry and seen by Reuters.

The ship's original owner, Hassan Yehia, is from Burg Mighizel, a village that lies a kilometre across the Nile from Rashid. The village is reputed to be the smuggling capital of the Nile Delta.

Yehia says the Abu Nawal was named after his daughter and mother. He gave conflicting accounts of his connection to the ship. He first said he sold the Abu Nawal in March to a Libyan merchant, but later he said he still half-owned the vessel, which was now in Libya.

But the people-smuggler said Yehia sold the ship in March to two men he identified as the ringleaders of the April voyage: Bougy, the smuggler from Alexandria, and his partner, Ahmed Obeid, 51. Obeid is known locally as Dr Obeid, or simply ""The Doctor.""

Security officials and fishermen described Obeid as the leading smuggler in Burg Mighizel. Both Obeid and Bougy were detained in prison between 2005 and 2008 as a threat to security under Egypt's three-decades-long state of emergency that was lifted in 2012, according to a senior Egyptian security official. The official said the pair remained pivotal in the smuggling business.

A broker directly involved in recruiting passengers for the April voyage independently identified Obeid and Bougy as organisers of the fated trip. So did two relatives of Egyptian victims on the voyage, who separately learned of their relatives' fates by questioning the brokers.

Yehia, the ship's original owner, said he knew Obeid, who was from the same village. ""You probably already know how dangerous this man could be,"" he said. ""Dangerous to an extent that would make me and others not talk about him.""

Police say both Obeid and Bougy have been sentenced in absentia several times by Egyptian courts for offences connected to illegal migration. The latest conviction in absentia, for a misdemeanour over the trafficking of several children who went missing in April, came after a complaint from parents. Both were sentenced to a year in jail, but remain at large.

Lawyers said police and prosecutors have not examined any connection with the April sinking. Lawyers also said those convicted of fraud would likely appeal their sentence if they were ever apprehended.

Obeid did not respond to messages left at his home in Burg Mighezel. His son Ibrahim said he acknowledged his father had arranged migrant trips but said there was no evidence tying him to the deadly voyage.

""If he arranges a trip, he does it in a way that pleases God,"" Ibrahim said, laughing. ""You'll never find any smuggler using his real name, so there isn't real proof that it's my father.""

Bougy could not be reached for comment.

THE DROWNING

It was about 2 a.m. on Saturday, April 9, when the middle boat reached the trawler. It was pitch dark and well beyond sight of the Egyptian coast. According to one fisherman with a close connection to smuggling gangs, the two vessels met a couple of hours' sailing off the port of el-Saloum, near the Libyan border.

In a rough sea and high winds, the middle boat was roped to the trawler. The smaller vessel's passengers, between 150 and 200 people, were forced to clamber across.

As the trawler, or ""big boat,"" rocked about, its growing load suddenly shifted to one side. It listed, and then began to keel over.

In panic, the crew on the middle boat cut the tethering lines and pushed their craft, which still had 27 migrants aboard, clear of the trawler.

Sandhool was now on the trawler's top deck. He began to pray. ""People on the boat all started screaming and crying together,"" he said. Hundreds were still crammed in the hold.

Sandhool was thrown into the water. ""Myself and a couple of young guys started to swim away to try and save ourselves."" Sandhool and a few others had brought along lifejackets; most had not.

Muaz Mahmud, an Ethiopian, was also thrown overboard with his wife and two-month-old infant. He survived. His family did not. ""I was trying to save them,"" he said later, tears sweeping down his cheeks. ""But I couldn't save them. They slipped away. Everybody was climbing over and hanging on me but I couldn't even hold on myself. So I took off all my clothes, left everything in the sea and tried to swim. I swam towards the light.""

That light was the single torch on the middle boat. For the next half-hour, the vessel moved through the water searching for the trawler's crew and its captain, whose name was Salem. The sailors on that boat ignored the pleas of the migrants in the water and brandished knives, threatening survivors like Muaz. Nevertheless, he made it aboard. But when he grabbed someone else's hand to pull him from the sea, he said a crewman punched him until he let go. The same crewman cut loose a rope that survivors were using to clamber up.

Gamachis Abdullah, another Ethiopian student, watched helpless from the middle boat as his mother and two brothers drowned. His eldest brother, Ramadan, nearly made it. ""He was shouting up to me but the crew forcibly made us leave everyone and go,"" Abdullah said.

The smugglers rescued Salem and two of the trawler's crew, but within minutes Salem died of an apparent heart attack and his body was dumped overboard. Then the smugglers sailed away, leaving behind, according to Muaz, at least 100 people still alive in the water.

Yusuf, the Cairo lawyer, said the overloading of the trawler amounted to premeditated murder. Accepting such a massive load, he said, ensured the vessel had little chance of arriving safely. And just as with the drownings near the shore, he said, while there was no specific Egyptian law about sea disasters, the crew's failure to rescue ""when it was in their hands to save people"" could be interpreted by courts as murder under Egypt's penal code.

Nashar, the senior official in the justice ministry, said a murder charge would require proof of a ""special intent to destroy a soul."" In smuggling cases, he said, ""the purpose is to transport individuals and smuggle them in exchange for profit."" But smugglers could be charged with manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. Laws against human trafficking, immigration and maritime laws, and laws protecting women and child rights could also have been violated.

The middle boat was equipped with radios, cell phones and a satellite phone, but none of its crew attempted to alert authorities, according to survivors. Instead, they said, the crew discussed whether to kill those left alive.

Osman Asad Mohamed, who understood Arabic from living in Yemen, said the proposal came from a tall, thin, pale-coloured smuggler, the one who had cut the ropes between the two ships. ""I remember his words clearly: 'Let's kill all of them and bring our boat back. Most of them are dead; they are of no value to us now.'""

Some survivors were so petrified by those words they hid in the middle boat's hold, clutching makeshift weapons for defence. But the smugglers never carried out the threat, said Mohamed, because they decided they were outnumbered by migrants.

The crew's failure to call for help was costly, say maritime safety professionals, because many of those in life jackets could have survived for hours. A senior Greek coast guard officer said the sea lanes off Egypt and Libya are busy with traffic exiting the Suez Canal. Those ships could have assisted had the survivors called, he said.

Mohamed recalled that just before the trawler sank, he noticed the lights of big ships in the distance.

RESCUE AND INACTION

At about 12.30 p.m. on April 16, a week after the disaster, the headquarters of the Italian coast guard in Rome received its first word of the sinking: a distress call from a satellite phone. The call came from one of the survivors aboard the middle boat.

By 2.19 p.m., the Italian coast guard had determined the boat was lying in international waters, within Greece's ""rescue coordination zone."" By treaty, maritime nations have divided the sea up into zones. Each country takes responsibility for rescue operations in its zone, even if it asserts no legal jurisdiction outside territorial waters, typically 12 nautical miles off the coast.

Just under two hours later, Greek coast guard officers in the port of Piraeus instructed a Dutch-operated bulk carrier, the 550-foot Eastern Confidence, to change course and find the boat full of survivors.

Obliged by maritime law to assist with the rescue, but not to collect evidence, the crew of the Confidence did not check the boat for identification marks or serial numbers that could have shown where the smugglers came from. The Confidence's operators, Orient Shipping Rotterdam, told Reuters the basic details of the rescue but declined further comment.

The Confidence ferried the survivors to the Greek port of Kalamata. It was here that they began to tell their story to the Greek coast guard, to the media, to agencies such as UNHCR, and, via phone, to families and friends. The survivors said that up to 500 people had drowned.

But while Greek authorities helped in the rescue and aided the survivors, they decided not to investigate the sinking. A source with knowledge of the case said that Greece's coast guard did not refer the case to a criminal prosecutor because there was no indication any crime had been committed on Greek territory.

Both the coast guard service and Nikos Paraskevopoulos, the justice minister, declined to comment.

If Greek authorities had questioned survivors more closely, they might have learned that some of their accounts were untrue - notably, the initial claim that the migrants had left from Tobruk in western Libya.

Based on interviews with survivors in Greece, the UNHCR repeated this erroneous account in an April 20 press statement.

In fact, nobody had left from Tobruk.

All the migrants set sail from Egypt, according to brokers involved, relatives who spoke to victims just before they embarked, and Egyptian security officials.

Sandhool, the young Somali, originally said he had boarded in Tobruk. But he later revised his story. ""I am really sorry I told you a lie,"" he said, explaining that survivors had agreed on the false story because they were worried they might be deported from Europe to Somalia or Egypt.

Survivors also failed to disclose that four of the Egyptians on the middle boat were sailors employed in the smuggling gang. Mahmud, the Ethiopian survivor, said the four had urged survivors to lie. ""The Egyptian smugglers were with us, and they told us that the Greece authority would return us ... if we tell them that we are from Egypt. This is the only reason why we told we are from Tobruk.""

Other survivors said they were grateful to these crewmen for keeping them alive and taking them to Greece.

NO MANDATE

Like Greece, Frontex, the EU border agency, did not investigate. Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman, said it had no mandate because launching investigations into potential crimes was a ""power reserved for national authorities.""

The European Union runs a naval mission off the Libyan coast - Operation Sophia - to identify and capture smugglers' vessels. In practice, it also operates as a rescue service, picking up more than 16,000 migrants from the sea from January through August 2016.

Captain Antonello de Renzis Sonnino, the operation's chief spokesman, said the force operated in an area ""just outside the Libyan territorial waters"" and has so far successfully identified 89 smugglers and traffickers that Italian authorities could prosecute. But asked about the April sinking, he said that based on ""the information we have, the disaster occurred far away from where we had our military vessels.""

NATO, which runs a separate naval mission in the Aegean to monitor illegal migration, began operations against people-smuggling in the Mediterranean last month. A spokeswoman said: ""No ships under NATO command were mandated to engage directly in counter-human trafficking activities in the Mediterranean in April.""

UNHCR, which assisted the survivors when they reached Athens, said it was not its job to investigate. ""UNHCR is there to help the survivors and warn travellers tempted to take the journey. We do not have the investigative mandate to go after organised crime,"" said chief spokesperson Melissa Fleming.

One entity does acknowledge it could investigate: Europol. Wainwright, the Europol chief, said his agency exists to help support such investigations, although it was required to get the cooperation of a member state.

Wainwright said he was willing to take the case on and would raise it at senior levels in Greece. But, he said, the country was short of resources and already burdened by a huge influx of migrants. Any response, he said, should ""be a European Union response.""

Law enforcement in Europe was increasingly overwhelmed by the scale of challenges posed by illegal migration, he said, whether it was drownings or child migrants who go missing. In contrast, if a single local child went missing in England, France or Germany, it attracted huge resources for police. ""It's almost a parallel world we are living in,"" he said. ""It's very frustrating.""

Somalia's Foreign Minister Abdusalam Omer said that the government asked Somali embassies to talk to officials and private organisations, such as those working with migrants, in Italy, Greece, and Egypt.

He declined to detail what help Somalia received, but urged a more compassionate response. ""If you can deploy a flotilla of ships ... to stop piracy off the coast of Somalia, why can one not deploy a flotilla of ships that saves lives in the Mediterranean? These are our children. And when I say our children, it is not just the Somali children, it is all our children, it is humanity.""

THE TRAIL TO CAIRO

Egypt also chose not to investigate. Local police in Alexandria mounted a partial inquiry into the disappearance of nine Egyptian teenage boys who left for Italy in April, but have not linked the boys' disappearance to the sinking.

One father, Abdo Abdul Hamid of Alexandria, gave a statement to police. That led to a prosecutor's report, reviewed by Reuters, which named some of the smuggling ringleaders. Six of them, including Bougy and Obeid, were convicted in absentia by a court in Alexandria of defrauding the boys' families. All remain at large.

""These people have to get punished,"" Abdul Hamid said. ""I will stay after them until they all go to prison.""

No Egyptian body has looked into the shipwreck itself, two senior security officials confirmed. Law enforcement officials said an ineffective legal system discourages action, and also blamed the pressure of other work. One senior security source said that illegal immigration was nothing new, and ""the priority is security and drugs at the moment.""

Under international law, if any of the ships involved in the disaster were flagged or registered in Egypt, as large fishing trawlers like the Abu Nawal are, then Cairo had a clear mandate and possibly even an obligation to investigate the disaster, according to Niels Frenzen, clinical professor of law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law.

Nashar, the senior official in Egypt's justice ministry, said that investigations into illegal migration were difficult because they often required collecting evidence and chasing criminals across borders, and because migrants were often reluctant to give evidence.

But, he said, ""I can confirm it is not in the interests of the investigating agencies, whether the general prosecutor or any relevant law enforcement authority, to cover up on such crimes.""

Nashar said that after another sinking in September, Egypt had rushed through the new law ""to combat the crime of illegal migration.""

In May, the six Egyptians who'd been rescued and taken to Greece - two teenage migrants and four crew - agreed to be sent home to Egypt. According to Cairo airport police records, the six told authorities they had left from an Egyptian beach.

That gave Egypt another reason to investigate. Instead of probing further, though, the police charged the six with crossing a frontier illegally.

The two teenage survivors and four smugglers were fined and paid 100 Egyptian pounds apiece, or $11. So far, this is the only punishment meted out in the sinking of the Abu Nawal.

4Mi is the Mixed Migration Centre’s flagship primary data collection system, an innovative approach that helps fill knowledge gaps, and inform policy and response regarding the nature of mixed migratory movements and the protection risks for migrants on the move. It is a regular, standardized, quantitative and globalized system, with a network of more than 120 field enumerators who are conducting survey interviews with migrants on the move in around 15 countries at any one point in time.

In-depth survey interviews with migrants

4Mi has a unique network of field enumerators situated along frequently used mixed migration routes and in major migratory hubs. Our enumerators use a standard in-depth survey to conduct more than 1,000 4Mi interviews per month with migrants who have recently arrived in a location or are still on the move. MMC has conducted more than 125,000 surveys since 4Mi began in 2014.

Through 4Mi, MMC places those on the move and what they say at the heart of our understanding of the mixed migration phenomenon, and the 4Mi approach enables MMC to gather extensive and timely data relating to individual profiles, drivers of migration, experiences and decision-making along the journey, interactions with smugglers, and aspirations and destination choices.

The Turkish authorities should stop pushing Syrian asylum seekers back at the border and should investigate all use of excessive force by border guards.

During March and April 2016, Turkish border guards used violence against Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers, killing five people, including a child, and seriously injuring 14 others, according to victims, witnesses, and Syrian locals interviewed by Human Rights Watch. Turkey’s Foreign Affairs Ministry maintains the country has an “open-door policy” for Syrian refugees, despite building a new border wall.



“While senior Turkish officials claim they are welcoming Syrian refugees with open borders and open arms, their border guards are killing and beating them,” said Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Firing at traumatized men, women, and children fleeing fighting and indiscriminate warfare is truly appalling.”



Since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards have pushed back Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April 2016, Human Rights Watch reported that Turkish border guards enforcing Turkey’s one-year-old border closure had shot at Syrians escaping advances by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), northeast of Aleppo. Human Rights Watch also revealed how Turkish border guards blocked thousands of fleeing displaced persons after their camps near the border had been hit by artillery fire on April 13 and 15.

The hostilities continue to threaten Syrians already displaced by fighting. According to witnesses, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, three airstrikes hit the Kamuna camp sheltering 4,500 displaced Syrians near Sarmada in northern Idlib province, five kilometers from Turkey’s increasingly impenetrable border. An independent humanitarian source in Turkey told Human Rights Watch that medics recovered 20 bodies, including two children, and that at least 37 people were injured, including 10 who lost one or more limbs and who were transferred to Turkey for medical care.



According to the Syrian Civil Defense, seven women and four children were also injured on April 24, when three artillery rounds fired by Syrian government forces hit al-Iqaa displaced persons camp near al-Zawf, located six kilometers northeast of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing. According to camp representatives, the al-Iqaa camp shelters many Syrians who have previously been pushed back by Turkish border guards.

Human Rights Watch interviewed victims and witnesses involved in seven incidents between the first week of March and April 17, in which Turkish border guards shot dead three asylum seekers (one man, one woman, and a 15-year-old boy) and one smuggler; beat to death one smuggler; shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three children, aged 3, 5, and 9; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers. Syrians living near the border also described the aftermaths of the shootings and beatings, including Turkish border guards firing at them as they tried to recover bodies at the border wall. One witness filmed a number of the dead and surviving victims and shared the videos with Human Rights Watch.



On May 4, Human Rights Watch sent a letter with these findings to the Turkish interior minister, urging Turkey to investigate the allegations made by Human Rights Watch, to order its guards not to shoot at asylum seekers, and to re-open its border to Syrians seeking safety.



Six of the incidents Syrian witnesses described took place near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, about 50 kilometers south of the Turkish city of Antakya. The seventh happened near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya. Seven of the injured people said they had briefly stayed in the Salaheddin camp for displaced persons in the village of Khurbat al-Juz, overlooking the newly-erected Turkish border wall nearby. Most of them, and others who traveled straight to the border, said they had recently fled fighting in and around Aleppo.





Between April 12 and 20, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 28 other Syrian asylum seekers who described Turkish border guards intercepting them as they crossed the border with smugglers between February and mid-April. They said guards detained them for up to a day, then pushed them back to Syria with dozens – and in some cases hundreds – of others. Some were living in the Khirmash IDP camp to the west of the Syrian town of Bidama. A representative of the camp told Human Rights Watch that on April 13, Turkish border guards in the nearby watchtowers used loudspeakers to announce in Arabic that no one should approach the border and that anyone who did would be shot.



Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by land army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since such specific information was not provided or known by many witnesses.



As of early April, Turkey had completed a third of its 911-kilometer rocket-resistant concrete wall along its border with Syria and was working to fortify the rest of its border.



Turkey is entitled to secure its border with Syria, but is obliged to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits rejecting asylum seekers at borders when that would expose them to the threat of persecution, torture, and threats to life and freedom. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity, including the absolute prohibition on subjecting anyone to inhuman and degrading treatment.

The violence against Syrian refugees, and Turkey’s refusal to allow them to cross the border, comes as the European Union has shut its own borders to asylum seekers. In March, the EU concluded a controversial migration deal with Ankara to curb refugee and migration flows to Europe, committing €6 billion in aid to assist Syrians in Turkey, reinvigorating Turkey’s EU membership negotiations, and offering the prospect of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal provides for Europe to return migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, including Syrians, who reach Greece by boat, on the grounds that Turkey is a safe country for them. The deal also commits the EU to work with Turkey to create areas inside Syria that will be “more safe.”



“The EU shouldn’t just stand by and watch as Turkey uses live ammunition and rifle butts to stem the refugee flow,” said Simpson. “EU officials should recognize that their red light for refugees to enter the EU gives Turkey a green light to close its border, exacting a heavy price on war-ravaged asylum seekers with nowhere else to go.”



Turkish border guard violence against Syrian refugees

In mid-April 2016, Human Rights Watch interviewed four victims, five witnesses, and six local Syrian residents who described seven occasions in March and April in which Turkish border guards shot or assaulted 17 Syrian asylum seekers and two smugglers. During the incidents, Turkish border guards killed five people (shot to death three asylum seekers and a smuggler and beat to death one smuggler); shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three young children; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers.



Six of the incidents occurred near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, near the Turkish town of Antakya, and one near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya.



Human Rights Watch also interviewed six Syrians from Khurbat al-Juz who helped some of the survivors and retrieved the bodies of those killed, in some cases coming under fire by Turkish border guards as they approached the bodies. One of the men, a security guard working in one of the local displaced persons camps, filmed a number of the victims and bodies.



Below is a summary of the seven incidents, in reverse chronological order. Human Rights Watch has a record of the names of all the victims and witnesses, but has not used them to help protect them and their relatives from possible retaliation should they reach Turkey. Victims who appear in the video are given pseudonyms. Other victims are not identified.



Human Rights Watch staff and a Syrian assistant and interpreter with close knowledge of the border areas and communities living there interviewed victims, witnesses, and local Syrians by cell phone. Staff explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.



Turkish border guards shoot dead two adults and shoot and injure two adults and two children near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, April 17

Human Rights Watch spoke with four people about the killing of two adults, and wounding of two adults and two children near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on April 17. A survivor of the shooting described in an April 20 interview by cell phone how he witnessed the deaths of his sister and cousin, called “Abdullah,” and how he and the other three were injured. A second brother of the dead woman confirmed her death, and two local men described helping two adults with one injured child leave the area and then retrieving the two bodies.



The man, who returned to his home area near Aleppo, described what happened:

After airstrikes destroyed many homes near where we lived next to Aleppo, 20 people in my family tried to flee to Turkey at the end of March, but the border guards at the Bab al-Salameh crossing would not let us through. The camp there was full, so we went to Khurbat al-Juz and found a smuggler to help us cross.

On Sunday, April 17, a smuggler took us at about 5 p.m. towards the border wall. Suddenly, when we were about 500 meters from the wall, we heard automatic weapons fired from the direction of the wall and bullets landed all around us. The women started screaming and the children started crying, but the shooting continued. We all threw ourselves onto the ground, covering the children. I was lying close to my sister and my cousin, and the bullets hit them while we were lying down. They stopped screaming and shouting. I knew right away they had been killed.

A bullet also hit my right hand. My other cousin was also injured in his right hand. They also shot and injured his 9-year-old daughter in both her legs and his 5-year-old son in his right leg. I saw it happen.

The shooting lasted a long time. I can’t remember for how long, but I think it was at an hour. We were all petrified. Then the shooting just stopped. We waited for a short while. We were all split up in different places. Some of us crawled back towards Khurbat al-Juz. While we were crawling we heard some more shooting. I was near my mother and I think one of the bullets landed near her head and she fainted. We had to leave her to get help. When we felt we were safe, we got up and walked the rest of the way. It took us a long time. I think we reached the village at 8 p.m. Someone found us and took us to a clinic there. My cousin and his children were missing and so was my mother and one of my brother’s children. I didn’t stay in the clinic. I went back with four local men to find the others and to get the bodies of my sister and cousin.

As we approached the place where the bodies were, the Turkish police [sic] started shooting again. The villagers called the police and asked them to stop shooting while we got the bodies. We walked back towards the bodies and this time they didn’t shoot. One of the police spoke to us from the wall using a loudspeaker. He said we had 15 minutes to move the bodies, after which they would start to shoot again. We picked up the bodies and carried them away from the wall as fast as we could. We rested when we were far away. It took us an hour to get them back to the village. We put the bodies in a local man’s house. Later next morning, we buried them in the local cemetery. My sister and cousin both had bullet holes in their back. My cousin also had two bullet holes in his right hand. We all left Khurbat al-Juz at 4 p.m. the same day and went to stay with relatives near Aleppo. That’s where we are now and we won’t try and go back to Turkey. It’s too dangerous.

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with two local men from Khurbat al-Juz who described how, during the early evening of April 17, they helped some of the survivors, including a man with an injured hand and his injured daughter who had been shot in both legs, leave the border area and reach Khurbat al-Juz and then went back with other locals to retrieve the two bodies. They said they found the bodies a few hundred meters from the border wall on the Syrian side, between two Turkish border guard towers near Turkey’s Nişrin and Kandıl police stations. They said the area was very close to the Sheikh Sayyah displaced persons camp on the Syrian side of the border, about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing.



They said Turkish police shot at their car as they approached the bodies. One described what happened next:

We reversed and drove south to the Khurbat al-Juz crossing point. We spoke to a Turkish border guard there and told them we were trying to recover two bodies near the border wall. He called the commander in charge of the nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base. I told him on the phone that there were dead and possibly some injured people on the Syrian side of the wall near Kandıl. He said we could go get the bodies, but should keep the car lights on. Then we drove back. I stayed at the car while the other four walked towards the bodies. They came back and said they had heard soldiers cocking automatic weapons so I drove back again to speak with the commander who said he would drive to the spot on the Turkish side of the body to make sure his men didn’t shoot at us.

I drove back to the area and walked with the others towards the bodies. We could see the commander on the other side holding a torch. We picked up the two bodies – a man and a woman – and took them back to the car and then to Khurbat al-Juz.

When we got back, I spoke to the brother and male cousin of the dead woman and man. I also spoke to the four people who had been shot and injured: the two men with injured hands and the two children hit in the legs. There were other children too who were not injured. Everyone in the group was from the same family. They said there were 10 adults and 10 children in the group, but apart from the two dead, there were two others missing: an older woman and a 6-year-old girl. I got permission from the Turkish commander to look for them the next morning and found them at about 9 a.m. near the border wall. They had stayed there all night in the dark, afraid of being shot.

Then we buried the bodies and the family left to go back to Aleppo.

Turkish border guards shoot dead a 15-year-old boy, on the night of April 14-15

On April 15, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with the two cousins of a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Turkish border guards the night of April 14-15, near the Syrian town of al-Duriya.



The dead boy’s 13-year-old cousin, who witnessed the killing, described what happened:

There were seven of us: three from Duriya, including my cousin, and four from Aleppo. We crossed the border last night near Duriya. We were in a valley called al-Nabua. I am not sure whether we were yet in Turkey, but suddenly the shooting started. My cousin fell down. He was shot in the head. I was next to him. There were bullets flying all around us. We threw ourselves on the ground. A few hours later the shooting stopped and we escaped. A few hours after that we went back to get the body.

On April 15, the dead boy’s other teenage cousin described by cell phone how they retrieved the body:

A few hours ago my brother called me to say Turkish border guards had shot dead our cousin. He asked me to help them bring the body back. He told me where they were and I went with two other friends. As we approached the group we heard shooting and we knew it was the Turkish border guards. We called the mayor of Karbeyaz [a Turkish border town] and asked him to tell the soldiers to stop shooting. He gave us a number for the border guard’s commander and one of the others called him. First he put the phone down. The second time he said, “Anyone who approaches the border will be killed.” The third time he gave us permission to get the body. That was at about 8 a.m. I went with my cousin and the Turkish border guards were waiting for us there. They let us take the body away.

Turkish border guards assault two men near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on April 7

On April 18, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone to a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who helped look after two men who told him Turkish border police had stopped them as they tried to cross into Turkey and assaulted them. He said:

Mid-morning on April 7, I got a call from a[n] [opposition] fighter at one of the Ahrar al-Shams checkpoints in Khurbat al-Juz. He said that two men had tried to cross to Turkey, but were badly beaten by the Turkish border police who had then left them back on the Syrian side of the border wall. He said the two men had walked to the check point and explained what had happened to them. I went to the checkpoint and I met the two men there in a small room. I spoke to them and filmed them.

One of them, called “Badri,” was from Homs and the other, called “Burhan,” was from Hama. Both of them are now back in Idlib province. They told me they had tried to cross to Turkey at al-Maklah, near the first Turkish border guard watch tower about 500 meters south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing point, but that Turkish border guards had caught them and then beaten them really badly. They also said there was a third man with them who the border guards also beat, but we never found out what happened to him.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure two men and young girl near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 29

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a man who was shot by Turkish border police and who also witnessed the shooting and wounding of another man and a young girl called “Elham” as they were heading to Turkey on March 29, near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. He said:

On March 29, at about 6 a.m. I was on my way to Antakya because I needed surgery on a broken hand. I had screws in the hand and I needed them taken out. I crossed the border with a smuggler in a group of 20, including my cousin and a woman from Deir al-Zor together with a little girl. We crossed about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. At the time there was no wall there. There is now. We crossed through a hole in the fence.

The smuggler told us he had a permit for all of us to enter Turkey. A few hundred meters into Turkey a border guard found us. I remember he was fat and fair-haired. He was standing about 10 meters from us when he told us to stop. The smuggler said to him in Arabic, “I have a permit” and the guard just raised his rifle and shot at us. Everyone started running. The bullets hit me in the back and they hit my cousin in the chest. It didn’t hit my spine but just a little to the right of the spine. One of the bullets also hit my bag. The little girl was hit in her leg. Everyone who wasn’t injured, apart from the woman, ran away. The soldier took my phone and then just told us to go back to Syria. My cousin was able to stand and walk and the woman helped me and the little girl walk.

We crept back through the hole in the fence and walked back towards Khurbat al-Juz. Suddenly we heard lots more shooting behind us and we hid for a half an hour without moving. Then the shooting stopped and we continued. From there we went to Ain Beyda clinic. My cousin was transferred to Darkush hospital. The hospital tried to get him to Turkey, but the soldiers at the gate told the hospital that no one is allowed across, even with very serious injuries. Some people in Khurbat al-Juz also described to the soldiers my injuries and asked if I could cross to Turkey for treatment, but they said no.

Turkish border guards beat smuggler to death and assault four men near Ain al-Kawakh near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 28

Human Rights Watch spoke with five people about the killing of one smuggler, called “Faisal,” and injuring of four others near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on March 28. They include one of the men who was beaten, who also witnessed the severe beating of the other four men and three local men from Khurbat al-Juz who recovered the dead smugglers’ body near the Syrian border village of Ain al-Kawakh and the Turkish police station of Nişrin, two to three kilometers north of Khurbat al-Juz and spoke with two of the assaulted men about what had happened.



On April 19, one of the assaulted men called “Ghassan,” who was later filmed by a local man from Khurbat al-Juz, described by cell phone what had happened to him and the other four men:

I am from the Kurdish mountains [Jebel el Ekrad] and am married with two children, aged three years and six months. All five of us fled fighting about 10 months ago. We went to Ikbane village for seven months, but then the regime attacked us in early February, so we went to the Ubeen [displaced persons] camp, but then the regime shelled the camp. I thought about going to Turkey, but I didn’t want to risk my children’s safety crossing with a smuggler. Everyone told me that the Turkish police were shooting at people.

So we went to live in the Salaheddin [displaced persons] camp in Khurbat al-Juz. But we had no money, so I decided to go to Turkey to find work. I found a smuggler and crossed with him and three other men towards the end of March. All four of them lived in the camp too, but I only knew the smuggler.

Just after we had crossed at about 5 a.m., we heard shooting close by. We lay down and shouted, “Don’t shoot.” Then the Turkish border guards arrived. They beat all of us and then they took us to a [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base very close by. As soon as we got there, about six border guards beat us really badly for a long time. They beat me all over my body and on my head. They used their fists and feet and sticks and rifle butts. I have no idea why they beat us. They didn’t say anything in Arabic. They were just shouting in Turkish, but all I really heard was the beating. I was in so much pain I lost track of what has happening. Then I passed out.

I woke up lying on the ground next to the wall on the border, on the Syrian side. It was late morning. I felt very sick and my whole body hurt a lot. A little further away I saw one of the other men from my group. He was lying on the ground and he was moaning for help. I got up and walked towards Khurbat al-Juz to get help for the other man. I met someone and told them where he was. Later that man told me they had found the smuggler’s body near the border wall. It’s better to die in Syria than to die under torture at the border.

On April 20, Human Rights Watch also spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who described how he met one of the other men, called “Hasim,” who had been beaten and whom he filmed speaking about what happened:

It was at the end of March, the same day we found the smuggler’s body. I was near the border and I saw a man walking slowly towards me from the border. He was stumbling and he was covered in blood. I went towards him and he said the Turkish border police had captured him and four other men. I took him to the nearby Ain Beyda clinic in my car.

In the car the man told me what had happened. He said he was a Turkmen from near Aleppo and had escaped the fighting there. He said he tried to go to Turkey with four others, but that the Turkish border guards had caught them and taken them all to a nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing. He said there the border police stripped them and beat them all very badly. He said that the other four all lost consciousness but he didn’t and that they took him in a pickup truck to the border wall and let him go.

On April 18 and 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with three locals from Khurbat al-Juz about how they recovered the body of the smuggler. All three of them described how Turkish border guards on a jeep repeatedly shot at them as they tried to approach the body lying a few hundred meters from the border wall, even though they had asked the local Turkish border guards for permission first.



Turkish border guards shoot dead smuggler near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, around March 20

Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who found the body of a smuggler called “Ibrahim” right next to the border wall close to the Salaheddin displaced persons camp in Khurbat al-Juz, around March 20. He said:

On the third Friday of March, people in the Salaheddin camp nearby told me there was a body next to the border wall near the camp. I called the Güveççi mayor and asked him to tell the border guards not to shoot us while we went to get the body. He said OK, so we went to the body and they didn’t shoot at us. The man was lying on the ground right by the wall near a gap in the wall where there are usually Turkish border police on the other side. He had a gunshot wound in the middle of his chest. I recognized the man because he was living in the Salaheddin camp before.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure man near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, first week of March

On April 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed a man by cell phone who was shot in the leg as he tried to cross to Turkey during the first week of March. He said:

I am from Jisr al-Shughur. I fled with my family because of the regime attacks on the town in February and March. We first tried to go to one of the [displaced persons] camps between Ain Beida and Khurbat al-Juz, but life there was very tough. So my wife and I decided to try to go to Turkey with our children.

About 35 days ago at eight in the evening we tried to cross in a group of about 13 in an area about two kilometers south of Khurbat al-Juz. There were about six men, four women, and three children in our group. A smuggler organized it but didn’t come with us. He sent two young boys, about 12 and 13, to help us cross. We approached the fence and suddenly we heard shooting. I felt pain in my leg and saw I was hit in the leg. I fell down. Everyone else ran away. I stayed in that place for about 30 minutes and I shouted for help. No one else was injured. The shooting stopped and then some men came and carried me back to Khurbat al-Juz. There was no shooting while they were helping me. They took me to Ain Beida hospital two or three kilometers away. The doctors told me I had one bullet above my knee and one bullet below my knee, in the left leg."

The fishing boat was sailing off the town of Izmir when he pulled in the nets and made the shocking discovery.

Izmir has been the most popular leaving point for the thousands of Syrian refugees who have crossed Turkey before attempting to cross to the nearby Greek island of Lesbos.

(Image: GETTY)

The fishermen, from the Foca district of Izmir, were sailing offshore in the Aegean Sea when they pulled in their nets to find the little girl's body, along with a pile of clothing.

They informed the Turkish coastguard who came out to the boat before escorting it back to Foca where the body was handed over to local police.

After an initial examination by the public prosecutor, the girl's body was taken to Izmir Forensic Medicine Morgue.

The tragic death of the refugee girl comes after harrowing images of lifeless Alan Kurdi caused international outcry in September last year.

Toddler Alan, 3, was found washed up on a Turkish beach and drowned along with his mother and brother as his family tried to reach Greece by boat.

(Image: GETTY)

The European Union recently agreed a deal with Turkey in an attempt to stop, or at least slow, the tide of Syrian refugees sweeping through the country, in the hope of reaching western Europe.

Many have drowned after paying people smugglers to ship them the short, but highly dangerous, journey to the Greek islands in often overcrowded and inadequate boats."

The Turkish authorities should stop pushing Syrian asylum seekers back at the border and should investigate all use of excessive force by border guards.

During March and April 2016, Turkish border guards used violence against Syrian asylum seekers and smugglers, killing five people, including a child, and seriously injuring 14 others, according to victims, witnesses, and Syrian locals interviewed by Human Rights Watch. Turkey’s Foreign Affairs Ministry maintains the country has an “open-door policy” for Syrian refugees, despite building a new border wall.



“While senior Turkish officials claim they are welcoming Syrian refugees with open borders and open arms, their border guards are killing and beating them,” said Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Firing at traumatized men, women, and children fleeing fighting and indiscriminate warfare is truly appalling.”



Since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards have pushed back Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April 2016, Human Rights Watch reported that Turkish border guards enforcing Turkey’s one-year-old border closure had shot at Syrians escaping advances by the extremist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS), northeast of Aleppo. Human Rights Watch also revealed how Turkish border guards blocked thousands of fleeing displaced persons after their camps near the border had been hit by artillery fire on April 13 and 15.

The hostilities continue to threaten Syrians already displaced by fighting. According to witnesses, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, three airstrikes hit the Kamuna camp sheltering 4,500 displaced Syrians near Sarmada in northern Idlib province, five kilometers from Turkey’s increasingly impenetrable border. An independent humanitarian source in Turkey told Human Rights Watch that medics recovered 20 bodies, including two children, and that at least 37 people were injured, including 10 who lost one or more limbs and who were transferred to Turkey for medical care.



According to the Syrian Civil Defense, seven women and four children were also injured on April 24, when three artillery rounds fired by Syrian government forces hit al-Iqaa displaced persons camp near al-Zawf, located six kilometers northeast of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing. According to camp representatives, the al-Iqaa camp shelters many Syrians who have previously been pushed back by Turkish border guards.

Human Rights Watch interviewed victims and witnesses involved in seven incidents between the first week of March and April 17, in which Turkish border guards shot dead three asylum seekers (one man, one woman, and a 15-year-old boy) and one smuggler; beat to death one smuggler; shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three children, aged 3, 5, and 9; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers. Syrians living near the border also described the aftermaths of the shootings and beatings, including Turkish border guards firing at them as they tried to recover bodies at the border wall. One witness filmed a number of the dead and surviving victims and shared the videos with Human Rights Watch.



On May 4, Human Rights Watch sent a letter with these findings to the Turkish interior minister, urging Turkey to investigate the allegations made by Human Rights Watch, to order its guards not to shoot at asylum seekers, and to re-open its border to Syrians seeking safety.



Six of the incidents Syrian witnesses described took place near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, about 50 kilometers south of the Turkish city of Antakya. The seventh happened near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya. Seven of the injured people said they had briefly stayed in the Salaheddin camp for displaced persons in the village of Khurbat al-Juz, overlooking the newly-erected Turkish border wall nearby. Most of them, and others who traveled straight to the border, said they had recently fled fighting in and around Aleppo.





Between April 12 and 20, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 28 other Syrian asylum seekers who described Turkish border guards intercepting them as they crossed the border with smugglers between February and mid-April. They said guards detained them for up to a day, then pushed them back to Syria with dozens – and in some cases hundreds – of others. Some were living in the Khirmash IDP camp to the west of the Syrian town of Bidama. A representative of the camp told Human Rights Watch that on April 13, Turkish border guards in the nearby watchtowers used loudspeakers to announce in Arabic that no one should approach the border and that anyone who did would be shot.



Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by land army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since such specific information was not provided or known by many witnesses.



As of early April, Turkey had completed a third of its 911-kilometer rocket-resistant concrete wall along its border with Syria and was working to fortify the rest of its border.



Turkey is entitled to secure its border with Syria, but is obliged to respect the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits rejecting asylum seekers at borders when that would expose them to the threat of persecution, torture, and threats to life and freedom. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity, including the absolute prohibition on subjecting anyone to inhuman and degrading treatment.

The violence against Syrian refugees, and Turkey’s refusal to allow them to cross the border, comes as the European Union has shut its own borders to asylum seekers. In March, the EU concluded a controversial migration deal with Ankara to curb refugee and migration flows to Europe, committing €6 billion in aid to assist Syrians in Turkey, reinvigorating Turkey’s EU membership negotiations, and offering the prospect of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal provides for Europe to return migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees, including Syrians, who reach Greece by boat, on the grounds that Turkey is a safe country for them. The deal also commits the EU to work with Turkey to create areas inside Syria that will be “more safe.”



“The EU shouldn’t just stand by and watch as Turkey uses live ammunition and rifle butts to stem the refugee flow,” said Simpson. “EU officials should recognize that their red light for refugees to enter the EU gives Turkey a green light to close its border, exacting a heavy price on war-ravaged asylum seekers with nowhere else to go.”



Turkish border guard violence against Syrian refugees

In mid-April 2016, Human Rights Watch interviewed four victims, five witnesses, and six local Syrian residents who described seven occasions in March and April in which Turkish border guards shot or assaulted 17 Syrian asylum seekers and two smugglers. During the incidents, Turkish border guards killed five people (shot to death three asylum seekers and a smuggler and beat to death one smuggler); shot and injured eight asylum seekers, including three young children; and severely assaulted six asylum seekers.



Six of the incidents occurred near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, near the Turkish town of Antakya, and one near the Syrian border town of al-Duriya.



Human Rights Watch also interviewed six Syrians from Khurbat al-Juz who helped some of the survivors and retrieved the bodies of those killed, in some cases coming under fire by Turkish border guards as they approached the bodies. One of the men, a security guard working in one of the local displaced persons camps, filmed a number of the victims and bodies.



Below is a summary of the seven incidents, in reverse chronological order. Human Rights Watch has a record of the names of all the victims and witnesses, but has not used them to help protect them and their relatives from possible retaliation should they reach Turkey. Victims who appear in the video are given pseudonyms. Other victims are not identified.



Human Rights Watch staff and a Syrian assistant and interpreter with close knowledge of the border areas and communities living there interviewed victims, witnesses, and local Syrians by cell phone. Staff explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.



Turkish border guards shoot dead two adults and shoot and injure two adults and two children near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, April 17

Human Rights Watch spoke with four people about the killing of two adults, and wounding of two adults and two children near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on April 17. A survivor of the shooting described in an April 20 interview by cell phone how he witnessed the deaths of his sister and cousin, called “Abdullah,” and how he and the other three were injured. A second brother of the dead woman confirmed her death, and two local men described helping two adults with one injured child leave the area and then retrieving the two bodies.



The man, who returned to his home area near Aleppo, described what happened:

After airstrikes destroyed many homes near where we lived next to Aleppo, 20 people in my family tried to flee to Turkey at the end of March, but the border guards at the Bab al-Salameh crossing would not let us through. The camp there was full, so we went to Khurbat al-Juz and found a smuggler to help us cross.

On Sunday, April 17, a smuggler took us at about 5 p.m. towards the border wall. Suddenly, when we were about 500 meters from the wall, we heard automatic weapons fired from the direction of the wall and bullets landed all around us. The women started screaming and the children started crying, but the shooting continued. We all threw ourselves onto the ground, covering the children. I was lying close to my sister and my cousin, and the bullets hit them while we were lying down. They stopped screaming and shouting. I knew right away they had been killed.

A bullet also hit my right hand. My other cousin was also injured in his right hand. They also shot and injured his 9-year-old daughter in both her legs and his 5-year-old son in his right leg. I saw it happen.

The shooting lasted a long time. I can’t remember for how long, but I think it was at an hour. We were all petrified. Then the shooting just stopped. We waited for a short while. We were all split up in different places. Some of us crawled back towards Khurbat al-Juz. While we were crawling we heard some more shooting. I was near my mother and I think one of the bullets landed near her head and she fainted. We had to leave her to get help. When we felt we were safe, we got up and walked the rest of the way. It took us a long time. I think we reached the village at 8 p.m. Someone found us and took us to a clinic there. My cousin and his children were missing and so was my mother and one of my brother’s children. I didn’t stay in the clinic. I went back with four local men to find the others and to get the bodies of my sister and cousin.

As we approached the place where the bodies were, the Turkish police [sic] started shooting again. The villagers called the police and asked them to stop shooting while we got the bodies. We walked back towards the bodies and this time they didn’t shoot. One of the police spoke to us from the wall using a loudspeaker. He said we had 15 minutes to move the bodies, after which they would start to shoot again. We picked up the bodies and carried them away from the wall as fast as we could. We rested when we were far away. It took us an hour to get them back to the village. We put the bodies in a local man’s house. Later next morning, we buried them in the local cemetery. My sister and cousin both had bullet holes in their back. My cousin also had two bullet holes in his right hand. We all left Khurbat al-Juz at 4 p.m. the same day and went to stay with relatives near Aleppo. That’s where we are now and we won’t try and go back to Turkey. It’s too dangerous.

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with two local men from Khurbat al-Juz who described how, during the early evening of April 17, they helped some of the survivors, including a man with an injured hand and his injured daughter who had been shot in both legs, leave the border area and reach Khurbat al-Juz and then went back with other locals to retrieve the two bodies. They said they found the bodies a few hundred meters from the border wall on the Syrian side, between two Turkish border guard towers near Turkey’s Nişrin and Kandıl police stations. They said the area was very close to the Sheikh Sayyah displaced persons camp on the Syrian side of the border, about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing.



They said Turkish police shot at their car as they approached the bodies. One described what happened next:

We reversed and drove south to the Khurbat al-Juz crossing point. We spoke to a Turkish border guard there and told them we were trying to recover two bodies near the border wall. He called the commander in charge of the nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base. I told him on the phone that there were dead and possibly some injured people on the Syrian side of the wall near Kandıl. He said we could go get the bodies, but should keep the car lights on. Then we drove back. I stayed at the car while the other four walked towards the bodies. They came back and said they had heard soldiers cocking automatic weapons so I drove back again to speak with the commander who said he would drive to the spot on the Turkish side of the body to make sure his men didn’t shoot at us.

I drove back to the area and walked with the others towards the bodies. We could see the commander on the other side holding a torch. We picked up the two bodies – a man and a woman – and took them back to the car and then to Khurbat al-Juz.

When we got back, I spoke to the brother and male cousin of the dead woman and man. I also spoke to the four people who had been shot and injured: the two men with injured hands and the two children hit in the legs. There were other children too who were not injured. Everyone in the group was from the same family. They said there were 10 adults and 10 children in the group, but apart from the two dead, there were two others missing: an older woman and a 6-year-old girl. I got permission from the Turkish commander to look for them the next morning and found them at about 9 a.m. near the border wall. They had stayed there all night in the dark, afraid of being shot.

Then we buried the bodies and the family left to go back to Aleppo.

Turkish border guards shoot dead a 15-year-old boy, on the night of April 14-15

On April 15, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with the two cousins of a 15-year-old boy shot dead by Turkish border guards the night of April 14-15, near the Syrian town of al-Duriya.



The dead boy’s 13-year-old cousin, who witnessed the killing, described what happened:

There were seven of us: three from Duriya, including my cousin, and four from Aleppo. We crossed the border last night near Duriya. We were in a valley called al-Nabua. I am not sure whether we were yet in Turkey, but suddenly the shooting started. My cousin fell down. He was shot in the head. I was next to him. There were bullets flying all around us. We threw ourselves on the ground. A few hours later the shooting stopped and we escaped. A few hours after that we went back to get the body.

On April 15, the dead boy’s other teenage cousin described by cell phone how they retrieved the body:

A few hours ago my brother called me to say Turkish border guards had shot dead our cousin. He asked me to help them bring the body back. He told me where they were and I went with two other friends. As we approached the group we heard shooting and we knew it was the Turkish border guards. We called the mayor of Karbeyaz [a Turkish border town] and asked him to tell the soldiers to stop shooting. He gave us a number for the border guard’s commander and one of the others called him. First he put the phone down. The second time he said, “Anyone who approaches the border will be killed.” The third time he gave us permission to get the body. That was at about 8 a.m. I went with my cousin and the Turkish border guards were waiting for us there. They let us take the body away.

Turkish border guards assault two men near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on April 7

On April 18, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone to a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who helped look after two men who told him Turkish border police had stopped them as they tried to cross into Turkey and assaulted them. He said:

Mid-morning on April 7, I got a call from a[n] [opposition] fighter at one of the Ahrar al-Shams checkpoints in Khurbat al-Juz. He said that two men had tried to cross to Turkey, but were badly beaten by the Turkish border police who had then left them back on the Syrian side of the border wall. He said the two men had walked to the check point and explained what had happened to them. I went to the checkpoint and I met the two men there in a small room. I spoke to them and filmed them.

One of them, called “Badri,” was from Homs and the other, called “Burhan,” was from Hama. Both of them are now back in Idlib province. They told me they had tried to cross to Turkey at al-Maklah, near the first Turkish border guard watch tower about 500 meters south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing point, but that Turkish border guards had caught them and then beaten them really badly. They also said there was a third man with them who the border guards also beat, but we never found out what happened to him.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure two men and young girl near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 29

On April 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a man who was shot by Turkish border police and who also witnessed the shooting and wounding of another man and a young girl called “Elham” as they were heading to Turkey on March 29, near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. He said:

On March 29, at about 6 a.m. I was on my way to Antakya because I needed surgery on a broken hand. I had screws in the hand and I needed them taken out. I crossed the border with a smuggler in a group of 20, including my cousin and a woman from Deir al-Zor together with a little girl. We crossed about two kilometers south of the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing point. At the time there was no wall there. There is now. We crossed through a hole in the fence.

The smuggler told us he had a permit for all of us to enter Turkey. A few hundred meters into Turkey a border guard found us. I remember he was fat and fair-haired. He was standing about 10 meters from us when he told us to stop. The smuggler said to him in Arabic, “I have a permit” and the guard just raised his rifle and shot at us. Everyone started running. The bullets hit me in the back and they hit my cousin in the chest. It didn’t hit my spine but just a little to the right of the spine. One of the bullets also hit my bag. The little girl was hit in her leg. Everyone who wasn’t injured, apart from the woman, ran away. The soldier took my phone and then just told us to go back to Syria. My cousin was able to stand and walk and the woman helped me and the little girl walk.

We crept back through the hole in the fence and walked back towards Khurbat al-Juz. Suddenly we heard lots more shooting behind us and we hid for a half an hour without moving. Then the shooting stopped and we continued. From there we went to Ain Beyda clinic. My cousin was transferred to Darkush hospital. The hospital tried to get him to Turkey, but the soldiers at the gate told the hospital that no one is allowed across, even with very serious injuries. Some people in Khurbat al-Juz also described to the soldiers my injuries and asked if I could cross to Turkey for treatment, but they said no.

Turkish border guards beat smuggler to death and assault four men near Ain al-Kawakh near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, on March 28

Human Rights Watch spoke with five people about the killing of one smuggler, called “Faisal,” and injuring of four others near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing on March 28. They include one of the men who was beaten, who also witnessed the severe beating of the other four men and three local men from Khurbat al-Juz who recovered the dead smugglers’ body near the Syrian border village of Ain al-Kawakh and the Turkish police station of Nişrin, two to three kilometers north of Khurbat al-Juz and spoke with two of the assaulted men about what had happened.



On April 19, one of the assaulted men called “Ghassan,” who was later filmed by a local man from Khurbat al-Juz, described by cell phone what had happened to him and the other four men:

I am from the Kurdish mountains [Jebel el Ekrad] and am married with two children, aged three years and six months. All five of us fled fighting about 10 months ago. We went to Ikbane village for seven months, but then the regime attacked us in early February, so we went to the Ubeen [displaced persons] camp, but then the regime shelled the camp. I thought about going to Turkey, but I didn’t want to risk my children’s safety crossing with a smuggler. Everyone told me that the Turkish police were shooting at people.

So we went to live in the Salaheddin [displaced persons] camp in Khurbat al-Juz. But we had no money, so I decided to go to Turkey to find work. I found a smuggler and crossed with him and three other men towards the end of March. All four of them lived in the camp too, but I only knew the smuggler.

Just after we had crossed at about 5 a.m., we heard shooting close by. We lay down and shouted, “Don’t shoot.” Then the Turkish border guards arrived. They beat all of us and then they took us to a [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base very close by. As soon as we got there, about six border guards beat us really badly for a long time. They beat me all over my body and on my head. They used their fists and feet and sticks and rifle butts. I have no idea why they beat us. They didn’t say anything in Arabic. They were just shouting in Turkish, but all I really heard was the beating. I was in so much pain I lost track of what has happening. Then I passed out.

I woke up lying on the ground next to the wall on the border, on the Syrian side. It was late morning. I felt very sick and my whole body hurt a lot. A little further away I saw one of the other men from my group. He was lying on the ground and he was moaning for help. I got up and walked towards Khurbat al-Juz to get help for the other man. I met someone and told them where he was. Later that man told me they had found the smuggler’s body near the border wall. It’s better to die in Syria than to die under torture at the border.

On April 20, Human Rights Watch also spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who described how he met one of the other men, called “Hasim,” who had been beaten and whom he filmed speaking about what happened:

It was at the end of March, the same day we found the smuggler’s body. I was near the border and I saw a man walking slowly towards me from the border. He was stumbling and he was covered in blood. I went towards him and he said the Turkish border police had captured him and four other men. I took him to the nearby Ain Beyda clinic in my car.

In the car the man told me what had happened. He said he was a Turkmen from near Aleppo and had escaped the fighting there. He said he tried to go to Turkey with four others, but that the Turkish border guards had caught them and taken them all to a nearby [Güveççi border gendarmerie] base near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi crossing. He said there the border police stripped them and beat them all very badly. He said that the other four all lost consciousness but he didn’t and that they took him in a pickup truck to the border wall and let him go.

On April 18 and 19, Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with three locals from Khurbat al-Juz about how they recovered the body of the smuggler. All three of them described how Turkish border guards on a jeep repeatedly shot at them as they tried to approach the body lying a few hundred meters from the border wall, even though they had asked the local Turkish border guards for permission first.



Turkish border guards shoot dead smuggler near the Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, around March 20

Human Rights Watch spoke by cell phone with a local man from Khurbat al-Juz who found the body of a smuggler called “Ibrahim” right next to the border wall close to the Salaheddin displaced persons camp in Khurbat al-Juz, around March 20. He said:

On the third Friday of March, people in the Salaheddin camp nearby told me there was a body next to the border wall near the camp. I called the Güveççi mayor and asked him to tell the border guards not to shoot us while we went to get the body. He said OK, so we went to the body and they didn’t shoot at us. The man was lying on the ground right by the wall near a gap in the wall where there are usually Turkish border police on the other side. He had a gunshot wound in the middle of his chest. I recognized the man because he was living in the Salaheddin camp before.

Turkish border guards shoot and injure man near Khurbat al-Juz-Güveççi border crossing, first week of March

On April 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed a man by cell phone who was shot in the leg as he tried to cross to Turkey during the first week of March. He said:

I am from Jisr al-Shughur. I fled with my family because of the regime attacks on the town in February and March. We first tried to go to one of the [displaced persons] camps between Ain Beida and Khurbat al-Juz, but life there was very tough. So my wife and I decided to try to go to Turkey with our children.

About 35 days ago at eight in the evening we tried to cross in a group of about 13 in an area about two kilometers south of Khurbat al-Juz. There were about six men, four women, and three children in our group. A smuggler organized it but didn’t come with us. He sent two young boys, about 12 and 13, to help us cross. We approached the fence and suddenly we heard shooting. I felt pain in my leg and saw I was hit in the leg. I fell down. Everyone else ran away. I stayed in that place for about 30 minutes and I shouted for help. No one else was injured. The shooting stopped and then some men came and carried me back to Khurbat al-Juz. There was no shooting while they were helping me. They took me to Ain Beida hospital two or three kilometers away. The doctors told me I had one bullet above my knee and one bullet below my knee, in the left leg."

French officials say a migrant from Pakistan has been killed in a hit-and-run accident on a road leading to the port in Calais, the fourth migrant death in the area this year.

The Pas de Calais Prefecture, the state authority in the northern France region, said the 24-year-old migrant was killed early Monday. Migrants told authorities that the migrant was struck by a car with a British license plate that fled the scene.

Migrants living in a nearby makeshift camp make nightly attempts to sneak to Britain, many moving onto the roadway to the ferry port in bids to sneak into freight trucks crossing the English Channel.

A 22-year-old Afghan was killed when hit by a truck on March 31. More than 20 migrants have died trying to reach Britain in less than a year.

A Finnish border official says authorities have broken up a ring of international human traffickers who allegedly smuggled migrants into the country at two Arctic border crossings with Russia.

1st Lt. Teemu Mantyniemi of the Finnish Border Guard says 16 people are suspected of organizing the transportation of at least 45 asylum-seekers from India to Finland via Russia in January and February. The 16 suspected smugglers are Swedish, Dutch, Indian and Pakistani. Police are holding 13 of the suspects.

Mantyniemi told The Associated Press on Monday that the smugglers charge migrants about 15,000 euros ($17,000) each for a journey from India.

Border guards investigated the smuggling ring with officials in several countries, including Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Poland and Russia.

More than 1,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Finland from Russia during January and February.

Germany’s Interior Ministry says the country continues to see high numbers of asylum applications as migrants who arrived last year are processed, but the numbers of new arrivals are down significantly.

The ministry said Monday that 60,943 asylum applications were filed in April, up nearly 125 percent over the same month last year but only 1.6 percent higher than March.

Some 1.1 million migrants arrived last year and it often takes months before they can formally apply for asylum. The number granted asylum in April remained around 50 percent, with about 10 percent more being allowed to stay for other reasons.

Meanwhile, April saw some 16,000 new arrivals, down from around 21,000 in March, 61,000 in February and 92,000 in January. The largest groups came from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Slovak officials say customs officers have opened fire at a car carrying migrants, injuring a woman.

Patricia Macikova, a spokeswoman for the Slovak Financial Administration, says the officials wanted to stop four suspicious cars coming from Hungary near Velky Meder shortly after midnight Monday. As one driver was trying to escape, Macikova says, an officer fired warning shots into the air before aiming at the car, injuring one migrant.

A 26-year-old Syrian woman was operated Monday morning in a hospital in nearby Dunajska Streda. Tomas Kral, a spokesman for a company that operates the clinic, said a projectile was removed from her back.

There was no immediate comment from police.

With border checks re-established on the Austrian-Hungarian border, the migrants could possibly go through Slovakia and the Czech Republic to get to Germany.

The maritime rescue service says it has picked up 44 sub-Saharan African migrants that set off in a boat from the west coast of Africa in a bid to reach Spain.

The service said the 42 men and two women were taken to the port of Arguineguin in Spain’s Canary Islands late Sunday after being rescued off the Western Sahara coast, some 100 nautical miles (200 kilometers) south of the islands.

The service said Monday it began the search for the boat after receiving a warning call from a non-government organization. The migrants were said to be in good health.

Thousands of migrants try to reach Spain each year either by attempting perilous sea journeys from the western Africa or across the Mediterranean Sea."

El Ministro de Comunicación, Mauricio Herrera, confirmó la muerte del inmigrante, cuyo destino objetivo era el mismo que el de cientos de africanos más que se encuentran a la deriva en el norte de Costa Rica, con el interés de cruzar hacia Nicaragua y continuar la ruta migratoria hacia Estados Unidos.

“El 19 de mayo se nos reportó el fallecimiento de una persona que de acuerdo con la autopsia que se le hizo, falleció por una bronconeumonía. Nos dieron los antecedentes de esa persona que en varias ocasiones intentó cruzar la frontera y fue devuelto en todas las ocasiones”, explicó Herrera.

“Estaba lamentablemente en malas condiciones y cuando sus amigos buscaron ayuda de las autoridades (de Costa Rica), estaba bastante deteriorada su salud después de muchos intentos de cruzar la frontera nicaragüense”, añadió Herrera.

Este migrante era parte de los cientos de extracontinentales que desde hace semanas se aglomeran en la zona norte costarricense, procedentes del sur del país donde el gobierno les habilitó dos centros de atención migratoria a los cuales, a su vez, entraron desde Panamá.

A unos mil cubanos Costa Rica les regularizó su condición migratoria pese a que no cuentan con pasaporte, y les permitió el libre tránsito por su país mientras se reportan a firmar permanencia ante las autoridades migratorias cada semana, hecho que no ha ocurrido en la mayoría porque en la práctica los africanos han encontrado una posibilidad de llegar a la frontera con Nicaragua para cruzarla.

En la zona de Peñas Blancas y en Puerto Soley, costa Pacífico, ambos lugares del fronterizo cantón de La Cruz, el gobierno de Costa Rica estima que hay entre 200 y 400 africanos viviendo a la intemperie, pero versiones extraoficiales estiman que la cifra puede ascender a 800.

Entre los grupos hay familias con mujeres embarazadas y niños, durmiendo a la intemperie, a orillas del mar en Puerto Soley o debajo de furgones en Peñas Blancas, haciendo sus necesidades fisiológicas al aire libre o bañándose en ríos aledaños.

Ante la dificultad que atraviesan, Herrera adelantó que el gobierno analiza abrir un centro de atención migratoria para facilitarles alimentación básica, asistencia en primeros auxilios, baños sanitarios y agua potable; pero aclaró que no se trata de una red de albergues similares a los que el país instaló durante la crisis con cubanos entre noviembre de 2015 y marzo de 2016, porque no existe capacidad estatal para hacerlos.

“Estamos buscando alternativas para abrir un centro de acogida migratoria en la zona norte para que a estas personas, que en este momento están a la intemperie en la zona de Peñas Blancas debido al bloqueo nicaragüense, se les garantice su dignidad personal y necesidades básicas”, explicó.

“No le llamaríamos albergues porque Costa Rica no está en condiciones de abrir una red de albergues como cuando los cubanos, pero es un centro de atención migratoria y humanitaria básica, muy posiblemente administrado por la Cruz Roja con apoyo de organismos internacionales y de algún apoyo del gobierno de Costa Rica”, aclaró.

Herrera explicó que el gobierno permitió el ingreso de los extracontinentales a su territorio, amparado en la legislación migratoria interna, apegado al respeto de los derechos humanos en casos de migrantes y que por lo tanto, ellos se mantienen en libertad en Costa Rica porque no son delincuentes.

“Son personas que están en libertad, no han cometido ningún delito y se les debe proteger sus derechos humanos, por lo cual, las autoridades costarricenses no pueden detenerlas ni presionarlas porque son personas libres, no son delincuentes”, señaló."

People smugglers in Niger abandoned 34 refugees – including 20 children – in the Sahara desert where they died of thirst.

A statement issued by the country’s Interior Ministry on Wednesday said that the group had died trying to cross the desert into neighbouring Algeria between June 6 and June 12.

“Thirty-four people, including five men, nine women and 20 children died trying to cross the desert,” a statement from the ministry read.

“[They] were abandoned by people smugglers.”

The statement said that only two of the bodies have so far been identified: a man and a 26-year-old woman, both from Niger.

It was not immediately clear what the nationalities of the other victims were.

Temperatures in the region can reach 42C, with powerful sandstorms tearing across the desert.

The hostile conditions mean that only a fraction of those who die trying to cross the area are ever found.

Dying of thirst

Thousands of migrants and refugees have arrived in Algeria in recent years, mostly from neighbouring Mali and Niger.

“They probably died of thirst, as is often the case, and they were found near Assamaka,” a security source told AFP, referring to a border post between Niger and Algeria.

Libya used to play host to the majority of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, but since that country descended into chaos following the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Algeria has become the main destination for the region’s refugees.

Many transit through Algeria headed for Europe.

The International Organization for Migration estimates that 120,000 people crossed through Agadez, in Niger, last year and said that 37 refugees died in the desert last year."

Nothing appeared suspicious about the causes of death, but autopsies had not been completed.

Agents notified San Diego police about 1 a.m. that a man’s remains were on an embankment next to I-5 south of Willow Road. The case was turned over to the California Highway Patrol because the body lay within state jurisdiction, on Caltrans property, authorities said.

The CHP said it appeared that the body had been there at least a few days. An autopsy was to be conducted to try to determine if the man had been hit by a car, killed in some other way, or died of natural causes or a drug overdose.

A Medical Examiner’s investigator said it may be some time before the man’s identity is known, if it ever is.

In the other case, a transient found the body of what authorities believe was another transient man beneath I-5 near India Street in Little Italy. The discovery was reported about 5 a.m. Tuesday.

The CHP said the man had crawled into a type of maintenance access doorway leading to the interior of the bridge, areas commonly taken over by the homeless. Other camping shelters were nearby."

Mediterranean,2016-06-23,1.0,,1,100.0,,,,Nigeria,Western Africa,Mixed or unknown,Libya,Central Mediterranean,"About 20 nautical miles from Sabratha, Libya",http://tmsnrt.rs/28PN4r8,4,"ABOARD THE TOPAZ RESPONDER, June 23 (Reuters) - Ships manned by humanitarian organisations, the Italian navy and the coast guard helped rescue more than 2,000 boat migrants on Thursday as calm seas returned to the Mediterranean prompting a surge in departures.

The Topaz Responder, a ship run by the Malta-based humanitarian group Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), said 23 different migrant boats had been spotted in the sea about 20 nautical miles from the Libyan port city of Sabratha.

Rescue operations were ongoing, the Italian coast guard said. ""The mass movement is probably the result of week-long, unfavourable weather conditions"" that have come to an end, MOAS said on Twitter.

The Topaz Responder picked up 382 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa from three different large rubber boats. The Bourbon Argos, a ship run by humanitarian group Doctors without Borders, rescued 1,139 from 10 different boats, and two other humanitarian vessels picked up 156 more.

German humanitarian group Sea-Watch said it had taken about 100 migrants and one dead body from a rubber boat, and the Italian navy said it had rescued 515 from two dinghies.

An agreement between Turkey and the EU to stop departures for the Greek islands has reduced boat arrivals by 98 percent during the first five months of the year from the same period of 2015, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.

But arrivals to Italy continue at about the same clip as last year, and the deadly central Mediterranean route has already claimed 2,438 lives, IOM said.

Italy has been on the front line of Europe's worst immigration crisis since World War Two, which is in its third year. More than 320,000 boat migrants came to Italy from North Africa in 2014-15.

As of Wednesday, 56,328 boat migrants had been brought to Italy, a 5.5 percent decrease on the same period of last year, according to the Interior Ministry.

Nigerians, Eritreans and Gambians were the top three migrant nationalities this year, the ministry said, and more than 125,000 are now living in Italian shelters.

Mediterranean,2016-06-25,6.0,,6,1000.0,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Mixed or unknown,Libya,Central Mediterranean,In Libyan national waters,http://www.globaldtm.info/libya,5,"The patterns and trends of human mobility determine the arrangement of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian actors need enough information on the composition and location of the concerned population to offer assistance and to react to the requirements appropriately. The conflicts and disasters have caused many displacements causing IOM to enhance the capacity of the current methodologies and systems of information management. To manage the response challenges effectively with a good awareness of human mobility, the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) was refined and improved by IOM. The system frequently captures, disseminates, and processes multi-layered data on the locations, mobility, needs, and vulnerabilities of the displaced as well as mobile populations throughout an issue.

DTM was conceptualized in Iraq in 2004 for tracking exercises and IDP assessments. The system has been frequently refined and improved over the years through its operational experience in natural disasters and conflict environments. They play a vital role in providing the basic information and data on displacement as well as population movements at the regional, national, and global levels. They support humanitarian partners, sectors, clusters, national authorities, stakeholders, etc. The implementations of DTM include natural disasters, conflict, and complex emergency settings from short-term, small-displacement to prolonged, large displacement cases.

DTM is also considered to be an effective mobility tool and supports both the transition and recovery phase regarding the reintegration and return processes. DTM can be integrated into activities of capacity building, mapping of probable displacement and evacuation sites, as well as setting up data-gathering mechanisms to remain vigilant before a disaster. This is how DTM is implemented as a tool for disaster preparedness.

Until November 2016, DTM provided internal displacement data to about 23 countries. When the information is available, more countries will be included in the matrix. The data offered by DTM includes demographics, the total number of people who are displaced, the conditions and needs of the people in the refugee camps, etc. The system also tracks secondary displacements and returns. This methodology predicts the initial stage of data collection using the major informants in the community and the data that is registered by the government. The second stage will be the validation of these data.

DTM has been effectively used to track different IDPs that are in the settings of the host community in countries like Iraq, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Nepal, Libya, Sudan, the Philippines, and Yemen. It has been successful in tracking cross-border combined migrations in the Central Mediterranean countries, Eastern Europe, Libya, and Nigeria.

DTM can be considered as a modular system that has several methods and tools that can be executed in different combinations corresponding to the practical needs of the existing situation. The operations of DTM are collective exercises. For wide access and coverage, IOM joins hands with humanitarian partners and national authorities.

DTM is proven to be highly effective in different countries to handle disasters and other major situations that lead to evacuation and displacement. With the advancement in technologies, further advantages can be expected from DTM. DTM is trying to make use of the advantages of blockchain technology. It is considered to be the safest method to store data. As DTM involves a large collection of data, the use of blockchain technology can be extremely useful. Crypto trading has made blockchain technology widely popular. Traders can use crypto robots for trading to make maximum profits from trading.

7:10 p.m.

The body of a migrant has been found not far from the road leading to the Calais port, apparently hit by a vehicle, the sixth migrant to die in Calais since Jan. 1.

The prefecture of the Pas de Calais region said the body was found on Monday morning in a field near the roadway used to access the huge ferry port. His identity, including nationality, wasn't immediately determined.

The body was found in a field in the region of the port roadway, where migrants try each night to hop a freight truck taking a ferry across the English Channel to Britain.

The prefecture said the injuries suggest the migrant was hit by a truck or other vehicle. Of the six deaths in Calais, he is the fourth to be struck by a vehicle.

Serbian police say they have arrested eight suspected people-smugglers as part of efforts to curb illegal transfer of migrants toward Western Europe.

Police said Monday the group smuggled several dozens of migrants from Serbia over the border to Hungary and then to Austria, earning between 1,100 and 1,200 euros per migrant.

The smuggling of migrants through the Balkans has been on the rise since nations shut their borders in March, closing down the previous refugee route toward Western Europe.

More than 1 million people entered Europe last year and nations have been closing their borders to curb the influx.

Italy's interior minister says police and prosecutors have cracked a transnational network dedicated to migrant trafficking.

Palermo-based authorities have detained 38 people suspected of being in the ring: 25 Eritreans, 12 Ethiopians and one Italian.

Interior Minister Angelino Alfano says the authorities dealt ""a harsh blow"" to the criminal network, which used Rome for its financial transactions hub.

Palermo police say in a statement that an Eritrean man who was arrested in 2014 collaborated with authorities, providing for the first time ""a complete reconstruction of criminal activities"" of migrant trafficking involving operations both in North Africa and Italy."

Among the SUV occupants was a man from Brazil, five men and a boy from Mexico, and four men of unspecified national origin who are lawfully admitted permanent United States residents, a Border Patrol official said. The driver was arrested.

The driver called 911 on a cellphone, reaching San Diego County sheriff’s dispatchers about 1 a.m. to report the crash involving several people allegedly smuggled across the Mexican border. The information was relayed to the Border Patrol’s El Centro office.

The cellphone signal was centered around Ocotillo in Imperial County along Interstate 8 and agents began searching that area west into San Diego County, Border Patrol Agent Guillermo Esparza said. Other agents searched along county road S2 near state Route 78.

The Civil Air Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations were notified, Esparza said.

Authorities received another 911 call about 3:20 a.m. from a man who said his arm was broken and his chest crushed when the vehicle rolled on him and into a ditch. A second man had fallen and was unconscious, according to information from the California Highway Patrol.

Both callers tried to describe their location about five miles past train tracks running north into the desert, and a trestle bridge.

A CHP aircraft crew finally spotted the wreckage in a wash in the Carrizo Impact Range about 7:20 a.m. The area is within the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, and rangers assisted in the search, a parks official said.

Border Patrol agents reached the victims and found one Mexican man dead. A seriously injured man was airlifted to a hospital. A Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations helicopter crew helped agents on the ground follow footprints leading to the driver, who had walked away, Esparza said. The man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling people.

At 5:05am yesterday, the Guangdong Provincial Maritime Search and Rescue Centre received a report of a person overboard in the waters near Nei Ling Ding, a mainland Chinese island in the Pearl River Estuary.

Shenzhen’s maritime rescue centre sent a coast guard ship to rescue the person, who informed them that they had been onboard a boat carrying 12 other people which had capsized, Headline Daily reports.

The Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Zhuhai Maritime Bureaus deployed six vessels in a joint operation to search for the missing people, believed to be refugees travelling towards Hong Kong.

By 2pm, 10 people reportedly from South Asian countries had been rescued and were in stable condition, while one corpse was found. Two people remain missing.

According to Oriental Daily, authorities have had difficulty communicating with the group due to language barriers, and have not been able to confirm their nationalities nor their destination.

Mainland authorities continue to search the waters for the missing pair.

The Hong Kong Marine Department told Oriental Daily that it was aware of the situation, and had notified ships passing through the area to be cautious and report any findings to them.

Caribbean,2016-07-20,,2.0,2,6.0,,,,Cuba,Caribbean,Mixed or unknown,United States of America,Caribbean to US,"Off the coast of Boca Raton, Florida",http://bit.ly/29VyRxq,1,"UPDATE: The United States Coast Guard has suspended its search for two migrants who were reported missing after six made their way to shore early Wednesday morning.

EARLIER STORY:

The search is underway for two missing Cuban migrants off the coast of Boca Raton.

This, after 6 migrants are rescued from the ocean early Wednesday morning.

The group was discovered during a routine patrol by the Coast Guard.

The rescued migrants telling crews that two more in their group were missing.

Coast guard members from Miami, Lake Worth and Fort Lauderdale are assisting in the search.

Meanwhile back on shore, the vessel that carried them here sat just a few miles from where they were rescued.

“Our security guard from the building called us, let us know that there was a boat on the beach,” said on-looker Pablo Rodriguez.

Signs of the wear and tear of that harrowing journey scattered across the boat.

The boat brought out a number of onlookers - including Alex Cleger.

He also left Cuba - his parents legally bringing him to America when he was a boy.

“From a young age, my folks [told] me all the hardship that they had to go through…those people are struggling over there.”

Grateful to be here, he says he can identify with the migrant's desire.

“I got to give them credit for trying if they are that desperate,” Clever says. “They know that America is home of the free and the brave.”

We are told that because those migrants didn’t make it to shore, they will be processed by immigration and likely sent back to Cuba.

As for the missing migrants, the coast guard will re-evaluate the situation and decide if the search needs to continue Wednesday night into Thursday.

EARLIER STORY

The U.S. Coast Guard rescued 6 Cuban migrants from the water off Palm Beach County Wednesday morning and is looking for 2 more.

The Coast Guard says the Cutter Gannett found the group about 2 nautical miles east of Boca Raton while on patrol.

They said the two missing from the group reportedly disappeared at sunset Tuesday.

An abandoned home-made boat ended up on a beach in Boca Raton south of Camino Real. The Coast Guard has confirmed the 'rustic vessel' is connected to the migrant search and rescue.

The 6 rescued migrants are in good condition although some are being treated for signs of dehydration, the Coast Guard said.

A Coast Guard Air Station Miami HC-144 Ocean Sentry airplane crew, crews from Coast Guard Stations LakeWorth Inlet and Fort Lauderdale, the Coast Guard Cutter Dolphin and a Customs and Border Protection Office crew are searching for the missing migrants.

Just in the past 2 weeks the Coast Guard has repatriated 33 Cuban migrants in 4 separate interdictions at sea.

""Migrants aboard overloaded and unseaworthy vessels are putting their lives at extreme risk of injury and death. The Coast Guard with our partner agencies continue to patrol vigilantly to rescue and repatriate undocumented migrants who take to the sea,"" Capt. Aldante Vinciguerra, chief of response for the 7th Coast Guard District, said following those incidents.

An Ethiopian was killed and six other migrants injured when clashes erupted on the outskirts of the migrant camp in France's northern port city of Calais, authorities said Tuesday.

Migrants queue for clothes distribution in southern part of the camp known as the ""Jungle"", a squalid sprawling camp in Calais, northern France, February 26, 2016.

A local government spokesman said migrants from Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia clashed with those from Afghanistan on Monday night, stabbing each other and hitting each other with sticks.

A 37-year-old Ethiopian died after being knifed in the chest, he said.

Police intervened several times in the clashes.

Fights often break out in the sprawling camp, home to thousands of migrants hoping to find a way across the Channel to Britain.

On May 26, 40 people were injured in a fight between Afghan and Sudanese migrants.

The spokesman said the migrants had also constructed about 30 barricades in the road in a bid to stop and board trucks heading to Britain.

Last week a migrant of unknown nationality was found dead on the highway near Calais, and local officials said he likely died while crossing the road or falling off a truck. He was the eighth migrant killed since January trying to make it to Britain.

Authorities say there are about 4,500 migrants in the camp known as the ""Jungle"", however charitable organisations estimate the figure is as high as 7,000.

Press Release

Military-style solutions won’t solve humanitarian problems, argues our new report that details the nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the English Channel since 1999. Deadly Crossings and the Militarisation of Britain’s Borders reveals the human tragedies caused by inhumane border enforcement at a time when the UK Home Office is seeking to make Channel crossings ‘unviable’

A transnational collaboration between the IRR, the Permanent People’s Tribunal London steering group & French group Gisti, Deadly Crossings is the first English-language analysis of Channel-related deaths. Published within weeks of the UK exit from the European Union, the report argues that far from the UK getting a handle on border control post-Brexit, further securitisation of its borders will only result in more human suffering.

PPT member, Don Flynn said, “The UK government tries to present migrant Channel crossings as a failing on the French side. But much of the hardship in the Calais region stems from the refusal of the British government to provide a safe passage for people with a legitimate claim to asylum in this country. This report is a tool for people who believe that the UK’s border policies need to be changed. What exists at the moment is nothing more than the extension of the brutality of the hostile environment to refugees.”

Translated from a publication originally written in French by Maël Galisson of Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France, the report features a timeline which shows the deaths chronologically; and an interactive map, showing them geographically.

With no official records chronicling the deaths of people trying to cross the Channel, the total number cannot be known, but it is hoped this report will give each person included an identity and a history. Galisson said, “This report is about challenging the idea that this massacre is the result of misfortune. Reducing these tragedies to accidents or framing them in terms of violence occurring between migrants, as we often see in the media, is a way of concealing the responsibility of public authorities for a situation that has lasted for more than twenty years”.

IRR Vice-Chair Frances Webber said, “These deaths are not ‘natural’ nor ‘tragic accidents’ but man-made, created by policies which do not merely close borders but also erect ever more obstacles to safe travel for the most vulnerable. Military-style solutions don’t solve humanitarian problems. They simply create more profit for the smugglers, and more suffering for the migrants. The history of the securitisation of the English Channel is a history of death. So why do we allow the government to keep on along the same path?"

One victim was found on board a wooden fishing boat, a coastguard spokesman said on Sunday.

The other bodies were pulled from the sea after 10 migrants either jumped or fell into the water as rescuers approached, the spokesman said.

Six of them survived, the Italian navy said, adding that life-saving first aid was performed on three of the people who had been pulled from the sea.

Vessels from Italy's navy and coastguard aided in the rescues, as did two ships run by humanitarian groups.

Around 90,000 migrants have reached Italy by boat this year, down slightly from the same period as last year.

About 3000 men, women and children have died so far trying to make the journey, the International Organisation for Migrants estimates.

Italy has been on the front line of Europe's migrant crisis for three years, and more than 400,000 have successfully made the voyage to Italy from North Africa since the beginning of 2014, fleeing violence and poverty.

People smugglers operating mostly out of Libya charge each migrant hundreds of dollars to make the crossing on unstable boats.

El tan anhelado «sueño americano» llevó a la muerte al santabarbarense Miguel Ángel Názar, quien salió el pasado 11 de julio rumbo a Estados Unidos para dar una mejor calidad de vida a su familia.

Lastimosamente hace poco se dio a conocer que el originario de Colinas, pereció por deshidratación en el desierto de McLean, muy cerca de Texas.

«Primo estoy perdido y temo por mi vida», dijo Miguel por última vez a un familiar y quien además era padre de una niña de apenas 5 años de edad.

La familia de este hondureño lo encomendó a Dios desde su partida y estuvieron por período de tres semanas en comunicación; sin embargo, ya cuando no sabían nada de él, comenzó su martirio aún más, pues pusieron la denuncia y la policía de Texas los buscó por tres días hasta que lo hallaron en un rancho, con su cuerpo casi consumido.

Qué haría usted si se quedara sin trabajo? ¿Qué haría si lo único que encuentra son empleos que no le permiten siquiera pagar un cuarto donde dormir?

Esto llevó a la desesperación a este hondureño, motivo por el cual inició una travesía que no pudo cumplir. Ahora su familia está solicitando ayuda al Gobierno de Honduras para repatriar su cuerpo.

El ‘sueño americano’ expresa el ideal de que todo ciudadano estadounidense tendrá las mismas oportunidades de tener éxito y prosperidad si trabaja duro, tiene determinación e iniciativa. El término se hace eco de la Declaración de Independencia, que establece la igualdad de los hombres por designio divino y les confiere como derecho inalienable la vida, la libertad y la búsqueda de la felicidad.

El denominado «sueño americano» se ha convertido en una pesadilla para miles de migrantes hondureños que arriesgando su vida siguen viajando de manera ilegal a Estados Unidos en busca de trabajo o de un familiar.

Durante muchos años lo más común fue que el viaje a Estados Unidos lo emprendieran solamente hombres, por el peligro que implica el recorrido por vía terrestre, cruzando Guatemala y México.

Pero con el tiempo las mujeres también comenzaron a correr el riesgo de viajar solas o con hijos hacia territorio estadounidense, con la misma idea de conseguir un trabajo para ayudar a su familia o en busca de otros de los suyos en el país del norte.

En Honduras los flagelos como la pobreza, el desempleo y la desintegración familiar, entre otros, contribuyeron a que aumentara el flujo de personas que a diario emprendían camino al “sueño americano”.

Con los migrantes también se ha multiplicado el número de traficantes de personas, quienes además han elevado el cobro por llevarlos, en una operación que puede durar entre 15, 30 o más días, dependiendo de los obstáculos que surjan en el camino, incluso de tipo climático.

Analistas locales consideran que mientras no haya suficiente seguridad, empleo y salarios dignos, no cesará la salida de hondureños en busca del «sueño americano», aún con las campañas para disuadir a niños, jóvenes y adultos para que no lo hagan por el peligro que representa viajar sin papeles a Estados Unidos."

Five bodies were recovered and one passenger was missing, presumed drowned, following the capsize on Thursday.

Some of the 21 survivors told aid workers there had been 27 people from eight Syrian families on the boat.

The Phoenix, a rescue boat run by the Malta-based NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas) and the Italian Red Cross (CRI), recovered the corpses of two women, one man and the baby while the five-year-old's body was picked up by a fishing boat, the organisations said.

Details of the tragedy emerged as the world's attention has been re-focused on the crisis in Syria by this week's poignant pictures of the bloodied, dust-covered face of four-year-old Omran following the bombing of his home in the war-torn city of Aleppo.

Moas co-founder Regina Catrambone said the latest deaths were a tragic reminder that hundreds of migrant children continue to perish at sea a year after toddler Aylan Kurdi's body was washed ashore on a Turkish beach last year.

'Very sad and frustrating'

""It is very sad and frustrating to witness the tragic loss of life at sea, especially that of such a young child,"" she said.

""It is time for the international community to come to terms with this reality and to implement safe and legal solutions for the most vulnerable among us to avail themselves of the rights and protections they are entitled to.""

Children represent a growing proportion of the migrants trying to reach Europe by sea from Turkey and North Africa - 27 percent of all arrivals in the first six months of this year were minors, according to the UN refugee agency.

Italy's coastguard said the five deaths occurred on a day when they supervised the rescue of 534 people in 11 different operations off Libya.

Nearly 100,000 migrants have landed at Italian ports this year, roughly in line with the level of arrivals in the same period in 2015. Numbers arriving in Greece have dropped sharply since an EU-Turkey deal in March that is aimed at stemming the flow.

More than 3,000 people have died trying to reach Greece or Italy since the start of the year, a 50 percent rise on last year.

It is relatively rare for Syrians to try to reach Italy via Libya. Over 90 percent of the migrants arriving on Italian shores this year have come from sub-Saharan Africa."

All were among groups of mainly young men trying to force the HGVs to slow down or stop so they can stowaway and get to England.

Referring to the death in Marck, around four miles east of Calais, an investigating source said: 'As two gangs from Sudan and Afghanistan competed to get on to the motorway to stop the lorries, a fight broke out.

'Weapons including knives and sharpened sticks were used, and the situation got very violent indeed.

The two migrants were among a group of people from the 'Jungle' camp who tried to access a motorway to smuggle onto trucks crossing the Channel to Britain (File photo)

'The man tried to get away, and was found covered in blood in a field close to a local canal. He was rushed to hospital, but died from his wounds.

'Others are still being treated in hospital. It was a hugely violent fight and there were similar disturbances in other parts of the road system.'

The A26 so-called 'English Motorway' passes through Marck, and it is always full of lorries and cars heading towards the Channel Tunnel and Calais port.

Detectives guarded by CRS riot police were on Tuesday making enquiries around Marck, and in Calais itself, as a murder investigation was launched.

The victim has not yet been identified, but a 35-year-old Sudanese man in hospital with serious head injuries is thought to have been with him at the time of the attack.

In July, another murder probe was launched after a migrant was hacked to death and another six badly wounded during a gang fight next to the so-called 'Jungle' refugee camp.

The bloodbath took place as the men fought running battles in the giant shantytown by the A16 motorway.

The deceased was described by the French authorities as a 37-year-old Ethiopian who had been hoping to claim asylum in Britain.

A police source noted growing tensions in the area, where the number of attempts by migrants to halt trucks and jump aboard had grown (File photo)

It came after aid workers warned of a 'pressure cooker about to blow' as the French authorities began tearing down cafes and restaurants in the Calais 'Jungle', and security is improved.

Charity groups fear that the entire refugee camp in the French port town is about to be destroyed, leaving the migrants with nowhere to stay while they wait to get across the Channel.

Meanwhile security has been improved massively since last summer, when migrants regularly got into the secure zones around the Tunnel and Calais port.

Numerous aid groups offering help to between 6000 and 9000 men, women and children staying in Jungle say the tactics are a recipe for disaster.

A spokesman for L'Auberge des Migrants (Migrant Shelter) said the camp 'is already a pressure cooker about to blow - the situation is extremely tense.'

Rioting frequently breaks out in and around the camp as migrants fight over everything from food supplies to deals with people smugglers.

In March, demolition experts supported by CRS riot squads dismantled the southern half of the camp.

The operation involved tear gas and baton charges being used against mainly young men fleeing war and poverty."
Mediterranean,2016-08-23,,7.0,7,,,7.0,,"Côte d'Ivoire,Gambia,Guinea",Western Africa,Drowning,Morocco,Western Mediterranean,"Unspecifed location between Morocco and Tarifa, Spain",http://bit.ly/2c7ONdw,1,"“THEY called me again at 5.30 am. I was the last one to talk to them alive,” Helena Maleno Garzon, a Tangier-based human rights worker for Walking Borders tells the Olive Press.

“They said, ‘Please help, we are having problems with the boat’. The wind was very bad that night. I spoke to Zakarias in French before the phone went dead.”

She sighs: “It’s very painful. Many times I am the last person who talks to them. The families always want to know what their last words were. And their last words are always, ‘Please help. I don’t want to die’.”

The seven African migrants, aged 20 to 25, were all known to Helena. The young men had left Morocco in a boat for Tarifa on August 23. But despite a rescue mission by Spanish and Moroccan coast guards, they weren’t found. Their families now face an agonising wait to see if their bodies will be recovered.

In her 15 years working with migrants crossing to Spain, it’s become a heartwrenchingly familiar tale for Helena. This year alone, 40 have died trying to cross to Tarifa, she tells me.

By contrast, the nine Moroccan migrants who pleaded guilty to entering Gibraltar illegally two weeks ago were some of the lucky ones. At least they were alive.

The men’s crossing from Africa ended when their inflatable boat landed near Catalan Bay two weeks ago. (see pic above)

The men, aged 21 to 35, fled, but were soon arrested by the Royal Gibraltar Police (RGP).

Deportation to Morocco is a certainty. But thousands enticed by Europe’s promise glittering across the blue expanse don’t survive the journey.

“Migrants don’t land in Gibraltar very often,” RGP officer Paul Chipolina tells the Olive Press.

“I’ve been a police officer for 20 years and I’ve hardly ever seen it.

“On the rare occasions it happens it is due to engine failure or confusion. We are very close to a major shipping transit route, so the crossing is not very safe. Plus there is another border for them to cross in Gibraltar.

“Not only that, but the waters are very heavily policed to guard against drug trafficking. So your chances of being discovered are much higher.”

Gibraltar may be low on the list of migrant destinations, but the past four years have seen a human exodus of biblical proportions along the Mediterranean.

According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), 1.4 million migrants have crossed in that time with 8,100 deaths recorded.

The number drowning so far this year – 3,164 – has already surpassed last year’s figure by 500.

Preferred destinations are still Greece (where 162,599 have arrived so far in 2016) and Italy (where 104,141 have arrived).

The numbers heading to the Spanish coast are smaller (the tidal wave of refugees fleeing the killing fields of Iraq, Syria and Libya don’t cross from Morocco.) and are mainly west Africans.

According to the IOM, so far this year, 2,476 migrants have landed in Spain, with 53 recorded deaths (human rights group Associacion Pro Derechos Humanos Andalucia put the number of deaths at 208). The IOM estimates hundreds have died since 2012.

Behind every one of these statistics is a story of hardship and suffering. Amadou Siribe, a 19-year-old from Mali, fled his poverty-stricken Bamako home in search of a better life.

He told the Olive Press how he and four friends almost died crossing to Spain in a blow-up dinghy.

“The water was very rough and dangerous,” he said. “One of us was bailing out because so much water was coming in.

“Dolphins were leaping out of the water and almost sinking the boat. I fell in the sea twice and had to be rescued. I swallowed so much salt water I became very sick. After six hours

I thought we were all going to die and began crying for my family.”

Hope, a young Nigerian woman, told the Olive Press how she survived a two-year ordeal after being trafficked to Spain by gangs.

“I saw people dying on the spot from disease and from scorpion bites,” says Hope of her journey through Libya to Morocco.

“We were piled on top of each other in an open truck in the desert. We ran out of water in the desert and had to drink our own urine.”

Hope eventually made the crossing to Spain in a ramshackle boat while pregnant along with 54 other desperate migrants.

Fortunately, Tarifa’s Cruz Roja scooped both her and Amadou from the sea. They are now assimilated into La Linea life (Amadou plays football for Real Balompédica Linense, Hope has two children and helps out at Hogar Betania, the crisis centre that helped her when she first arrived).

But others, like the men Helena knew, are not so lucky.

“The situation is a tragedy,” she says. “When the migrants are in the sea they usually call us between Morocco and Tarifa. If they’re crossing somewhere else, the phones don’t work.

“The boats they use are more like toys.

“We have cases of people rescued off the Andalucian coast. Sometimes the ship might have been lost at sea for 10 or 11 days, people die and sometimes a person drinks piss to survive.

“When that person is rescued they are arrested by the Spanish police. Nobody is considering that person spent 10 days in the sea.

“They need help. Like the victim of trauma or a tragedy.”

This is the hidden face of pretty whitewashed ports like Tarifa, the frontline in the battle to keep the Campo de Gibraltar’s waters safe. Young kitesurfers, lured by the Mediterranean’s whipping waves, have made this one of the coast’s hippest destinations.

But mainland Europe’s most southern point is also a magnet for Africa’s migrants and refugees. The Salvamento Marítimo’s 100-strong team patrols the waters 24/7 off Cadiz, with Tarifa the main focus of their attention.

“The majority are in a state of shock when we find them,” Salvamento Marítimo captain Jose Cristobal Romero told the Olive Press.

“The cold is one of the problems they have to face. Tiredness is a key factor because they try to row for a long time in boats that are not adequate.”

According to figures supplied by Salvamento Marítimo, 1,219 migrants have been rescued at sea and taken to the sanctuary of the pretty whitewashed port so far in 2016.

If they make it, migrants are taken to a detention centre on Tarifa’s Isla de las Palomas (around 90% are put out on the street after 60 days).

Campaigners APDHA have called for the centre – or CIE – to be closed, saying it is illegal to hold people there.

“The CIEs don’t meet the legal conditions,” APDHA member Andres De La Pena says.

“People here are suffering from lack of psychological care, inadequate medical care, lack of adequate translation, legal misinformation, inadequate social services, lack of clothes.”

But still the migrants keep coming. Desperation means there is often no other choice."

4Mi is the Mixed Migration Centre’s flagship primary data collection system, an innovative approach that helps fill knowledge gaps, and inform policy and response regarding the nature of mixed migratory movements and the protection risks for migrants on the move. It is a regular, standardized, quantitative and globalized system, with a network of more than 120 field enumerators who are conducting survey interviews with migrants on the move in around 15 countries at any one point in time.

In-depth survey interviews with migrants

4Mi has a unique network of field enumerators situated along frequently used mixed migration routes and in major migratory hubs. Our enumerators use a standard in-depth survey to conduct more than 1,000 4Mi interviews per month with migrants who have recently arrived in a location or are still on the move. MMC has conducted more than 125,000 surveys since 4Mi began in 2014.

Through 4Mi, MMC places those on the move and what they say at the heart of our understanding of the mixed migration phenomenon, and the 4Mi approach enables MMC to gather extensive and timely data relating to individual profiles, drivers of migration, experiences and decision-making along the journey, interactions with smugglers, and aspirations and destination choices.

Mediterranean,2016-09-01,1.0,,1,1050.0,,1.0,,Papua New Guinea,Oceania,Mixed or unknown,Libya,Central Mediterranean,Unspecified location between North Africa and Italy,http://bit.ly/2c5XJB8,4,"Come annunciato nella giornata di ieri la nave “Reina Sofia”, battente bandiera spagnola, è attraccata questa mattina, intorno alle 8:45, al porto commerciale di Salerno. Agganciata in mare aperto da un rimorchiatore e scortata da due motovedette della Guardia Costiera, l’imbarcazione militare con a bordo 1050 migranti (tra i quali una persona deceduta originaria della Nuova Guinea), è giunta senza difficoltà nel porto del capoluogo dove ad attenderla c’erano forze dell’ordine, mediatori culturali, protezione civile, il settore socio-formativo delle politiche sociali diretto da Rosario Caliulo, l'assessore alle Politiche Sociali, Nino Savastano e le associazioni di volontariato. Dopo i controlli di rito, una parte dei migranti verrà trasferita fuori regione: 100 in Veneto, 100 in Lazio, 50 in Abruzzo, 100 Piemonte 100 Lombardia e 50 in Umbria. Gli altri, invece, saranno inviati a gruppi di 100 nelle altre province campane, 148 resteranno nel Salernitano. A bordo - secondo indiscrezioni - ci sarebbe un caso di sospetta meningite. La precedenza è stata data ovviamente al recupero della salma presente sulla nave. Il fratello e un amico del defunto sono stati fermati dalle forze dell'ordine per essere interrogati.

A coordinare le operazioni sulla banchina il Prefetto Salvatore Malfi, che spiega: “E' il quattordicesimo sbarco. Gli imprevisti sono sempre dietro l'angolo, non a caso siamo nel porto commerciale. Il mio pensiero va alla persona deceduta a bordo. Conosciamo un po' tutto, anche il barcone dal quale è venuta. La persona morta dovrebbe essere seppellita qui, tranne che subentri una famiglia che richieda la salma. La metà dei migranti resterà nelle strutture della Regione. Le altre, invece, distribuite sul territorio"". Sulla eventuale presenza di scafisti a bordo il Questore Pasquale Errico non si sbilancia: “Non sappiamo se ci sono scafisti a bordo. Il livello di attenzione non è mai calato, in linea con le direttive internazionali. Non conosciamo ancora la causa del decesso della persona che si trova a bordo. Ci sono principi di umanità che ci impongono di accogliere: è un dovere morale, prima come uomini e poi come istituzioni"". Un appello rivolto ai sindaci, in particolare dell'Agro Nocerino, affinchè accolgano nelle loro strutture i migranti arriva dal segretario della Cgil Anselmo Botte: ""Facciano la loro parte. Accogliere è un dovere. Le strutture impegnate, fin qui da tutto il Sud, sono già tutte al collasso""

Sui disagi, inevitabili, che si vengano a creare nel porto durante gli sbarchi è intervenuto il presidente dell'Autorità Portuale Andrea Annunziata: ""Se le navi restano in rada per aspettare le operazioni di sbarco, si può creare un effetto domino e non è escluso che in futuro qualche armatore decida di abbandonare Salerno. Non è un problema di Autorità unica portuale: gli sbarchi li decide il Ministero dell'Interno e noi ci adeguiamo. Noi siamo pronti ad accogliere ma se la metá viene poi smistata nelle regioni del Nord Italia, sarebbe opportuno pensare anche ad altri porti, ad esempio Genova"" Alle ore 10.10 i migranti iniziano a scendere dalla nave: precedenza a donne incinte e bambini. Avviati anche i controlli sanitari da parte dei medici.

Sono ore di lavoro intenso per il settore socio formativo delle Politiche Sociali, guidato dal direttore Rosario Caliulo. ""E' uno sbarco diverso, l'esperienza della salma a bordo non ce l'aspettavamo. Secondo le nostre informazioni, è stato trovato morto sul barcone e consegnato dai militari all'autorità portuale. Qualche minore lo abbiamo intravisto. Se l'esperienza non ci inganna, sono presenti anche in numero considerevole - così Caliulo - Ci siamo organizzati dopo la conclusione del briefing, lungo e complicato a causa dello sbarco nel porto commericiale. Abbiamo attivato i nostri meccanismi, di concerto con la Prefettura. Sono presenti i volontari del Nucleo di Protezione civile locale, 20 persone che lavorano dall'alba, dalle ore 4, con la protezione civile regionale. Sbarco delicato perchè ipochi migranti parlano inglese, francese e spagnolo, le lingue veicolari. In molti parlano un dialetto della loro terra ed è difficile anche per i mediatori culturali. Abbiamo subito prestato soccorso ad una famiglia di quattro persone, con una bambina che ha bisogno di monitoraggio costante e cure immediate. Le strutture di accoglienza al Sud sono quasi al collasso. Le polemiche, quelle sulla necessitá di ospitare o meno i migranti, sono sterili e appartengono alle singole persone. La nostra esperienza di accoglienza locale per minori e neo maggiorenni è eccezionale: la percentuale di allontanamento dalle strutture è zero, i ragazzi vanno a scuola, imparano lavori artigianali, cuciono vestiti. Salerno ha un grande cuore"", ha concluso.

Emergono, intanto, ulteriori dettagli in merito alle generalitá della persona deceduta. Si tratta di un uomo, etá 30 anni, originario della Nuova Guinea. Ha provato a raggiungere l'Europa insieme a suo fratello e a un loro amico ma non ce l'ha fatta. La salma, presa in consegna dagli uomini dei Servizi Cimiteriali, è stata condotta al Cimitero di Salerno, in camera mortuaria."

Nuovo sbarco questa mattina al Porto Canale di Cagliari

CAGLIARI – Nuovo sbarco di migranti questa mattina al Porto Canale di Cagliari. La nave “Dattilo” della Guardia costiera nazionale è approdata nel capoluogo sardo con a bordo 931 persone, tra cui 102 donne e 202 bambini, tratti in salvo nei giorni scorsi nel Canale di Sicilia. Tra i migranti purtroppo anche tre morti. “Il Governo sta utilizzando la nostra terra come una nuova, più grande, Lampedusa- il commento del coordinatore regionale di Forza Italia, Ugo Cappellacci– non c’è nessuna finalità umanitaria nella scelta illogica di deviare nell’Isola migliaia di persone dirette altrove“. Si tratta per l’ex governatore sardo di una “vile scappatoia del Governo dello scaricabarile, incapace, ridicolo sul piano internazionale, che con questa politica non fa altro che alimentare il circuito di morte, di tratta di persone e del malaffare. Quando si mette di nuovo il mare tra queste masse di disperati e la loro destinazione, è evidente che si sta innescando una polveriera”.

All’attacco anche il deputato di Unidos Mauro Pili (“Il ministero dell’Interno sta trasformando la Sardegna in un hub per migranti con il vergognoso silenzio della Regione”, ribadisce) e il consigliere del Psd’Az Marcello Orrù: “L’ho detto più volte e lo ribadisco: la Sardegna non può più accogliere migranti. Non bastano le timide parole del presidente Pigliaru di qualche giorno fa, serve un vero e proprio ultimatum ad Alfano che esprima il no della regione Sardegna a questa politica sull’immigrazione ipocrita e fallimentare che non è accoglienza ma solo business e malaffare. Ma dubito che questo ultimatum arrivi”.

Ecco allora l’appello direttamente ai primi cittadini della Sardegna: “Ribellatevi, non date più alcun consenso a ricevere immigrati nei vostri comuni. Fate votare ai vostri consigli comunali una mozione che neghi il consenso a qualsiasi nuovo arrivo di immigrati sul proprio territorio comunale”. Questa sarebbe “l’unica possibilità tecnico-giuridica- conclude Orrù- per mettere in difficoltà le politiche di gestione immigrazione del Governo”.

México está por entrar a la fase 3 de la pandemia por covid 19 y se han anunciado el reforzamiento de medidas para contraatacar las afectaciones en la salud y la saturación del servicio médico público en el país, por lo que se han tomado medidas para afrontar en el país en la fase tres.



Ante las llamadas de emergencia en las próximas semanas a finales del mes de abril e inicios del mes de mayo, el subsecretario de Prevención y Promoción de la Salud, Hugo López-Gatell anunció que México está por entrar a la fase 3 de la pandemia de COVID-19, por lo que nuevamente llamó a la población a quedarse en casa, respetar la sana distancia y respetar las medidas de seguridad como el lavado de manos y evitar tocarse la cara.



Por su parte el gobierno México buscará comprarle 10 mil ventiladores y 10 mil monitores a Estados Unidos como parte del equipo para atender a pacientes graves por la enfermedad de COVID-19.



Debido al crecimiento acelerado por contagio de COVID-19, autoridades de salud informaron que la fase 3 podría declararse en los próximos días, por lo que es importante seguir al pendiente de la información oficial de las autoridades sanitarias respecto a esta pandemia.



La fecha estimada para el inicio de la fase 3 es entre el 11 y 24 de abril, de acuerdo a lo que indicó el subsecretario Hugo López Gatell.



Esta fecha coincide con las que Gustavo Cruz Pacheco, investigador del Instituto en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS) de la UNAM, aseguró que la propagación del COVID-19 en la Ciudad de México se encuentra en una etapa de crecimiento exponencial, es decir, el crecimiento continuará durante algunas semanas hasta el 30 de abril, aproximadamente.



A partir de esta fecha, se estima que la cantidad de personas contagiadas cada día sea menor, pero no se detendrá y la epidemia alcanzará su pico más alto entre el 6 y el 13 de mayo.



El subsecretario Hugo López Gatell también informó que la fase 3 se debe considerar por la sobrecarga del sistema de atención médica, particularmente los hospitales, incluyendo las terapias intensivas. /



Se distingue la fase 3 cuando la enfermedad se encuentra en la mayor parte del territorio nacional y ya se habla de contagios comunitarios (y no importados, como fue durante la fase 1), de acuerdo con la OMS.



En la Fase 3 las medidas de cuidado e higiene nuevamente se puntualizan como una medida de prevención ante una pandemia que aún no se encuentra la cura o medicamentos para curar el covid 19, tales como:



-Distanciamiento social y quedarse en casa.



-Suspensión de eventos públicos en espacios abiertos como plazas y parques.



-Sin regreso presencial a clases.



-Suspensión de actividad en todos los centros laborales que presenten brotes activos de COVID-19.



-Lavado frecuente de manos con jabón o gel antibacterial



Recordemos que las medidas de protección buscan que los niveles de contagio sean menores y por supuesto que el nivel de gravedad de la enfermedad sea en cifras menores.



La Fase 3 en México estará presente más próximo de acuerdo a cómo avancen los contagios en el país y su velocidad, además anunciar esto, busca evitar que los enfermos por COVID-19 no sean en estado grave y por lo tanto no se llegue a una saturación del sector salud. Recordando las medidas básicas de prevención como el lavado de manos y la sana distancia.

Sono già 12* in pochi mesi gli incidenti mortali causati della chiusura della frontiera francese a Ventimiglia. Annegati, investiti, precipitati, fulminati, i migranti muoiono tentando di attraversare, oppure si perdono e si feriscono in luoghi pericolosi. Ecco il primo di tre reportage di Michele Luppi e Andrea Quadroni sulle morti di confine, con una mappa interattiva dei luoghi dove queste persone sono rimaste uccise tentando di attraversare.

Si chiamava Alfatehe-Ahmed Bachire, aveva 17 anni e veniva dal Sudan. È lui l’ultimo migrante morto al confine italo-francese, lo scorso 13 giugno, annegato alla foce del fiume Roja. Testimoni raccontano del tentativo di recuperare una scarpa finita in acqua e di un incidente che si trasforma in tragedia. Per Intersos, Ong impegnata a Ventimiglia nell’assistenza legale e sanitaria dei migranti fuori dal sistema di accoglienza, questa morte non sarebbe una semplice fatalità, ma la conseguenza del degrado in cui, da mesi, si trovano a vivere i migranti arrivati in città nel tentativo di attraversare la frontiera.

“È una morte che fa rabbia e di fronte alla quale lo stato non può chiudere gli occhi”, spiega Cesare Fermi di Intersos, “perché nasce da una perdurante e vergognosa condizione di degrado, deliberatamente alimentata nel territorio di Ventimiglia da una politica di militarizzazione, repressione e negazione dell’accoglienza: respingimenti arbitrari di minori da parte della polizia di frontiera sul lato francese, rastrellamenti e deportazioni sul lato italiano”.

Non è la prima volta che un migrante muore nel fiume che attraversa Ventimiglia. Il 21 novembre 2016 un uomo era stato travolto dalle acque; il suo corpo non è mai stato ritrovato. E sono 11 i migranti morti dal settembre 2016 al confine tra l’Italia e la Francia: otto di loro sono rimasti uccisi nel tentativo di attraversare il confine mentre tre sono deceduti quando ancora si trovavano a Ventimiglia. Ai due casi già citati si aggiunge quello del migrante investito il 4 gennaio 2017 nei pressi del centro di accoglienza allestito dalla Croce Rossa al Parco Roja. Nell’impatto ha perso la vita anche il conducente italiano della vettura.

Stando a quanto dichiarato dalla Polizia di frontiera durante una conferenza stampa organizzata alla vigilia del G7 di Taormina, nel corso del 2016 – considerando i valichi di Ponte San Ludovico, Ponte San Luigi, Olivetta San Michele, Fanghetto, così come alla stazione ferroviaria di Ventimiglia e la barriera autostradale dell’A10 – sono stati effettuati dalle autorità 17.048 respingimenti.

“La decisione francese di ripristinare i controlli alla frontiere risale all’11 giugno 2015”, racconta il direttore della Caritas di Ventimiglia-Sanremo, Maurizio Marmo, “siamo arrivati alla terza estate e rispetto allo stesso periodo dello scorso anno i numeri sono raddoppiati”.

Sono circa 300 gli ospiti nel campo allestito dalla Croce Rossa, ma i migranti presenti in città sono molti di più. Un centinaio – tra donne, bambini e minori di 16 anni – hanno trovato un riparo nella chiesa di S. Antonio, nel quartiere delle Gianchette. Gli altri, fra le 300 e le 400 persone, hanno vissuto per settimane in un vero e proprio accampamento informale sul greto del fiume Roja. Questo fino al 26 giugno, quando un gruppo di circa 400 profughi – preoccupati dalle operazioni di pulizia della zona ordinate dal comune di Ventimiglia – hanno imboccato in massa i sentieri che conducono in Francia. La maggior parte di loro è stata bloccata nelle ore successive dalle autorità francesi e riammessa in Italia. Oltre un centinaio di loro sono stati poi trasferiti in pullman verso l’hotspot di Taranto.

“Queste situazioni”, ci dice il vescovo di Ventimiglia Antonio Suetta, “espongono i migranti a gravi pericoli che, nei mesi scorsi, hanno portato anche a delle vittime. Penso soprattutto ai tanti minori stranieri non accompagnati che rappresentano una parte consistente dei migranti presenti a Ventimiglia. A loro deve essere garantita un’accoglienza degna”.

Perché, oltre alle persone che hanno perso la vita, sono decine i casi di migranti rimasti feriti. Giovani come Yasir, vent’anni, originario del Sudan. Quando lo incontriamo, lungo il corso del fiume Roja, ha una vistosa fasciatura al piede. “Mi sono ferito tre giorni fa”, racconta, “su uno dei sentieri che conducono in Francia. Ero già in territorio francese quando sono stato sorpreso dalla polizia. Ho provato a scappare ma sono scivolato su una pietraia e mi sono ferito. Allora mi hanno fermato e riportato al confine”.

Morti alla frontiera

Il 21 marzo scorso, il quotidiano francese Nice-Matin ha dato la notizia del ritrovamento del cadavere di un migrante sul versante francese della montagna: due giorni prima, notata al parco Roja l’assenza di un ospite, erano scattate le ricerche sul territorio italiano, ma senza successo. Il suo corpo è stato trovato lungo il sentiero Grimaldi, al confine tra Mentone e Ventimiglia, sopra Ponte San Luigi, uno dei varchi utilizzato dai migranti. Soprannominato “passo della morte”, è un camminamento impervio percorso negli anni da antifascisti e contrabbandieri per passare il confine in segreto.

“Il corpo è stato rinvenuto dopo parecchi giorni e non è da escludere che ci possa essere stata qualche altra vittima di cui non abbiamo avuto notizia”, racconta Maurizio Marmo. “Purtroppo, in diversi punti il sentiero presenta delle biforcazioni, e chi non conosce la strada rischia di ritrovarsi sul ciglio di qualche burrone”.

Per sfuggire alla polizia di frontiera, il 6 settembre 2016 un giovane di origine africane di cui non si conosce il nome è caduto da un viadotto dell’autostrada A8, all’altezza del villaggio di Saint Agnés, all’uscita di Mentone. Un mese dopo, il 9 ottobre 2016, Milet Tesfamariam, una minorenne eritrea di 17 anni, è stata investita da un tir sulla A10, al confine con la Francia. Si trovava in compagnia di alcuni parenti e stava camminando lungo la galleria che si incontra dopo la barriera di Ventimiglia, appena prima dell’ingresso in territorio francese. L’autotrasportatore ha riferito di aver visto il gruppo di migranti attraversare la carreggiata; ha provato a frenare di colpo, ma non ha potuto evitare la giovane.

Meno di due settimane dopo, il 21 ottobre, i quotidiani francesi hanno riportato la notizia di un giovane migrante investito da una vettura diretta verso l’Italia sull’A8, vicino a Mentone. “Secondo la polizia”, scrive Le Parisien, “diverse persone erano già state segnalate all’inizio della notte su questo tratto di autostrada percorsa dai migranti dall’Italia alla Francia, alcuni sono stati recuperati e portati alla polizia di frontiera”.

Treni pericolosi

Se le segnalazioni di migranti intenti ad attraversare il confine a piedi sono sempre più frequenti, il mezzo che ha causato più vittime negli ultimi dieci mesi resta però il treno. Il 23 dicembre 2016 nella frazione di Latte, vicino a Ventimiglia, un regionale diretto a Nizza sulla linea Ventimiglia-Mentone ha investito un gruppo di migranti in cammino lungo la ferrovia verso la Francia. Un venticinquenne algerino è stato sbalzato sulla massicciata ed è morto sul colpo.

Secondo il reportage di Mediapart, la procedura della Sncf, l’ente ferrovie francese, prevede che in caso di incidente in cui siano coinvolte altre persone, il macchinista debba fermarsi, scendere a ispezionare le rotaie e avvisare il posto di blocco affinché fermi la circolazione fino a quando non saranno intervenuti la polizia e i soccorritori. Inoltre, la linea è tortuosa, con gallerie non illuminate e pessima visibilità. Per fermare un treno servono tra i 300 e gli 800 metri. Spesso gli incidenti accadono col buio: gli attraversamenti avvengono in particolare la mattina presto o a fine giornata.

“Il venerdì è sicuramente uno dei giorni di maggior pressione”, ci racconta Daniela Zitarosa, operatrice legale di Intersos, “perché è giorno di mercato e moltissimi francesi vengono a Ventimiglia per fare acquisti. I migranti cercano di approfittare della confusione per salire sui convogli”.

Alcuni si nascondono sotto i sedili o nella locomotiva di coda oppure in spazi più pericolosi: i quadri elettrici, i giunti a soffietto, gli armadietti degli attrezzi. Altri cercano, invece, l’ingresso in Francia camminando lungo i binari della ferrovia. Il 5 febbraio di quest’anno, all’interno della galleria Dogana, l’ultima prima del confine con la Francia, un migrante è stato travolto da un treno regionale francese diretto in Italia. La vittima era insieme ad altri stranieri. Dodici giorni dopo, alla stazione La Bocca di Cannes, il cadavere di un uomo di origini africane è stato trovato senza vita, folgorato, sul tetto di un treno in sosta, incastrato nel pantografo del convoglio, il dispositivo installato sui veicoli ferroviari e tranviari che si collega ai cavi dell’alta tensione. Sempre nella stessa stazione, il 20 maggio di quest’anno, il personale Sncf addetto alle pulizie ha trovato a bordo di un treno regionale Ter, in un piccolo locale adibito a quadro elettrico, il cadavere folgorato di un trentenne del Mali.

Di fronte a queste morti le ferrovie francesi hanno predisposto un volantino informativo per mettere in guardia dai rischi e hanno chiesto alle associazioni attive a Ventimiglia un sostegno per la sua diffusione. La speranza è che possa servire ad evitare altre morti.

Morti senza nome

Guardando a quanto succede al confine italo-francese non colpisce solo il numero delle morti, ma anche la difficoltà di reperire informazioni circa le generalità delle vittime e l’attuale collocazione delle salme. “Purtroppo”, precisa Marmo, “la maggior parte delle morti sono avvenute in territorio francese e non sappiamo se e come vi sia stata una sepoltura. Da questo punto di vista si fatica ad avere un quadro generale della situazione”.

C’è però una morte che alla chiesa di S. Antonio – luogo simbolo dell’accoglienza cittadina – ricordano tutti con particolare affetto. Perché tra i 20 mila migranti transitati dalla struttura dalla sua apertura, il 31 maggio 2016, c’era anche Milet Tesfamariam, la diciassettenne eritrea investita il 9 ottobre. “Abbiamo celebrato il funerale il 15 ottobre nella stessa chiesa in cui lei aveva dormito la notte prima di morire”, racconta il parroco don Rito Alvarez. “Erano presenti decine di migranti, molti dei quali eritrei, e tanti volontari italiani e francesi, così come semplici cittadini”. Tra loro anche un cugino della giovane che vive a Roma, arrivato per il riconoscimento della salma. La parrocchia ha anche lanciato una colletta per raccogliere i circa 5 mila euro necessari al rimpatrio della salma. “Ci sembrava un gesto doveroso per ridarle dignità”, ammette il parroco.

Ai funerali era presente anche il vescovo di Ventimiglia Suetta che, durante l’omelia (qui la seconda parte) ha pronunciato parole molto dure: “Milet è una vittima del regime ingiusto del suo Paese, dal quale è scappata. Un paese che tutti conoscono, ma di cui nessuno si occupa. Milet è una vittima delle nostre frontiere, tanto legali quanto ingiuste, quando vengono sbattute in faccia alle persone e si chiudono inesorabilmente dinnanzi al loro grido di aiuto. Milet è la vittima di una società che si dice civile, che sbandiera principi, quelli della fraternità, della libertà, dell’uguaglianza, principi in nome dei quali sono state perseguitate e uccise delle persone. Principi che non vengono applicati in maniera uguale per tutti. Ci sono coloro che sono più fratelli, più liberi e più uguali degli altri. Questa è una ingiustizia di cui la nostra civiltà si deve vergognare. Milet è una vittima dei tanti fascicoli che giacciono per troppo tempo sui tavoli di coloro che hanno responsabilità, di procedure ingiuste che diventano una dilazione nel dare giustizia ai poveri che chiedono aiuto”.

*Aggiornamento: proprio poco dopo la pubblicazione di questo articolo, ci è giunta notizia di una dodicesima morte, quella di un migrante di cui ancora si ignora la nazionalità, che è stato travolto e ucciso da un camion a Latte.

*aggiornamento: purtroppo gli incidenti mortali nell’area di Ventimiglia continuano, e in alcuni casi emergono notizie di decessi avvenuti in precedenza, come quello del 24 maggio 2017: un uomo senegalese ritrovato, anche lui folgorato, dentro al locale tecnico di un treno francese partito da Ventimiglia.

Il 16 agosto 2017, invece, u n migrante iracheno di 36 anni è morto investito da un treno all’imboccatura della galleria di zona Peglia a Ventimiglia.

But during the course of the operation, five bodies were recovered - including one heavily pregnant woman.

At 9.20am the James Joyce initially rescued 106 migrants on board the first vessel before moving to a second vessel, which contained 164 migrants.

This boat included several people that were in need of urgent medical attention.

They were taken to the LÉ James Joyce for treatment, which was provided by both Defence Forces medical personnel and the Red Cross.

But one man and four women - one of whom was heavily pregnant - were pronounced dead.

The other migrants are now on board LÉ James Joyce, where they are receiving food, water and medical treatment.

The ship is transferring all the rescued migrants, along with the deceased, to the Italian Navy ITS Bersagliere.

They will then be brought to a designated port of safety."

The death of a 14-year-old boy, killed on a French motorway while trying to reach his family in Britain, despite having a legal right to asylum in the UK, has sparked urgent calls for the Government to stop playing “disgusting politics” with the lives of refugee children.

The young Afghan – who has a brother and two uncles living in the UK – was killed in a hit and run accident on Friday after trying to jump on to a lorry.

He had already started the legal process to join his family in Britain but had been left languishing in the Calais Jungle migrant camp for more than three months due to delays in the system. He is thought to be the youngest victim to lose his life in an attempt to reach Britain from the camp, although because some children are often travelling alone, some deaths go unrecorded.

The news comes as an exclusive report seen by The Independent reveals the number of unaccompanied minors living in the makeshift refugee camp has soared by 51 per cent in the past month to 1,022.

David Miliband: UK should take four times more refugees

The dead boy had been “waiting so long he lost faith in the system and thought his only option was to risk his life in order to finally reach safety”, according to the charity Help Refugees, which confirmed the death.

“Like the children still trapped in the Jungle, he is likely to have experienced enormous hardship, police violence, hunger and poor mental health. He would have felt he had no rights and that he was not worth the protection of any state. He could have been with his brother, he could have been in school, he could have been safe.

“Instead he is lying on a cold bed, having been identified by volunteers at the Refugee Youth Service.”

Neha Shah works at the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe where she said the 14-year-old spend time learning English or watching films in the evening. She told The Independent: ""He was one of the quieter boys and he was very gentle and very polite. He was extremely determined at everything we did. We'd have English lessons and he always wanted his accent to be perfect.""

She added: ""He often spoke about his big brother who was in the UK and who he had the legal right to join and was trying to reach when he died.""

The boy is the second to have died trying to cross the border this year despite being part of the charity Citizen UK’s Safe Passage programme – a non-government funded legal team helping reunite refugee children with their families in Britain.

Lliana Bird, co-founder of Help Refugees, told The Independent: “Witnesses say he had managed to climb onto the back of a lorry, which swerved to try and get him off. He fell and was hit by a car. Neither the lorry nor the car stopped. Many other children witnessed his death and are traumatised by what they saw.”

The boy’s family are in Calais today but do not wish to share further details of his identity and have ask for their privacy to be respected.

(Help Refugees report) ( Help Refugees )

The death of the youngster has prompted outrage from campaigners and politicians as the Government faces mounting pressure of their handling of the Calais crisis ahead of this week’s UN summit on refugees.

Labour peer Lord Dubs said: “It’s disastrous this kid has been killed but sadly it is not surprising because the British Government continues to drag its heels. These children with family in the UK have homes to go to so there is no excuse for delays.”

While a small number of child refugees have been brought to Britain under family reunification laws, their cases have only been successful with the help of private intervention and there remains no state-funded system in place.

Meanwhile not a single child has been brought to Britain under the wider provisions of the “Dubs amendment” made to the immigration bill in May, despite more than 200 children living in Calais being eligible under the criteria.

The true scale of the crisis is revealed in the latest census of the Calais camp carried out by Help Refugees, which shows the population of the Jungle has increased by 12 per cent in the past month, topping 10,000 for the first time.

1,179 are children while the number of unaccompanied minors has increased by 51 per cent in the last month to 1,022. The youngest children living alone there are two eight-year-old boys.

(Help Refugees report ( Help Refugees report )

Annie Gavrilescu, a field manager for Help Refugees, based in Calais, said: “There has been a huge increase in the number of unaccompanied children in the past few weeks and we are also seeing more unaccompanied girls than previously.”

She said the spike in numbers could be due to the closure of other refugee camps in Italy and France, and more children making the journey from Libya to Italy due to improved weather conditions.

Ms Gavrilescu said: ""All they want is to reach their families and somebody in an office wearing a suit is preventing them from doing that by refusing to sign a bit of paper.”

She added: “All this time the Home Office and the French authorities are blaming each other and using these children as pawns – it’s disgusting politics.”

Labour’s refugee taskforce chair Yvette Cooper told The Independent: “The thought of eight-year-olds alone each night in the Calais camp should appal us all. Ministers know how bad this is. They have been warned again and again. There must be no more excuses or delays.”

Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband has also ramped up pressure on the Government by calling for Britain to take in “20,000 or 25,000” refugees a year – roughly four times the rate in the original pledge made by ministers a year ago of 20,000 by 2020.

Speaking ahead of UN summit on refugees on Sunday he said: “I think there is quite a lot of scope for Theresa May to come to the UN and to the Obama summit on Tuesday and say ‘look the UK has a really good record on international overseas aid... but we can also make a greater contribution beyond the six refugees per parliamentary constituency’.”"

Tours, France, Sep 24 – President Francois Hollande, under pressure from the right wing, on Saturday stepped up his pledge to combat illegal migration, vowing to dismantle a squalid settlement near Calais and prevent similar camps from becoming established in France.

“There will be no camps in France,” said Hollande, two days ahead of a maiden visit to the notorious “Jungle” settlement near Calais, where between 7,000 and 10,000 desperate migrants live.

The Socialist leader spelt out promises to “completely dismantle” the Jungle and set up “reception and orientation centres around the country” to accommodate asylum-seekers.

Hollande’s government has vowed to scrap the Jungle “before winter” and a flurry of preparations underway there suggest the operation may begin shortly.

Migration has been a low-key issue under Hollande’s four-year-old presidency.

But he has been forced to take a visible stance on the issue, under pressure from his conservative predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy — who is hoping to make a comeback as president — and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.

Each are promoting platforms of security, patriotism and national interest in early campaigning for next year’s elections.

“We will provide a humane, dignified welcome to people who will file for the right of asylum,” Hollande said.

Those whose request has been rejected “will be escorted out of the country. Those are the rules and they are fully aware of them.”

He noted that France would accept 80,000 asylum-seekers this year, a fraction of that accepted by Germany.

Separately, the top administrative office, or prefecture, for the Pas-de-Calais region said a Sudanese migrant aged about 30 died late Saturday when he was hit by a freight train near the port of Calais.

He was the 13th migrant to die in the Calais area since the start of the year, according to an AFP poll.

Most of the deaths have been people who have tried to board trucks heading to Britain via the Channel Tunnel or ferry.

Meanwhile, Sarkozy returned Saturday to remarks on national identity that sparked a fierce row earlier this week.

On Tuesday, Sarkozy said that once immigrants are granted citizenship “they should live like the French.”

“Once you become French, your ancestors are the Gauls. ‘I love France, I learned the history of France, I see myself as French’,” is what you must say,” he said.

The remarks sparked a storm, prompting historians to note that France has been a land of immigration for centuries and the line “our ancestors the Gauls” was an opening to history textbooks that today is widely derided.

On Saturday, Sarkozy extended his “Gauls” reference and provided what he contended was a patriotic benchmark for Muslim immigrants to France.

“Our ancestors were the Gauls, they were also the kings of France, the Enlightenment, Napoleon, the great Republicans,” he told a rally in the southwestern town of Perpignan.

“Our ancestors were (also) the colonial troops who died at the Chemin des Dames in World War I, the Muslim riflemen who died at Monte Cassino,” he said referring to a battle against German troops in Italy in 1944.

Sarkozy paid special tribute to the Harkis — Muslim auxiliaries who fought alongside French troops in Algeria’s bloody 1954-1962 war of independence.

“In our national story… a special place is reserved for French Muslims who died for our freedom and flag,” he said.

It was determined that the dead body was a male around 15 years old, with police investigating the possibility that the boy was a refugee who died while trying to cross over to Greece.His body was sent to the forensic medicine institute in the neighboring province of İzmir for an autopsy after inspections at the scene were completed.The incident has recalled the case of drowned refugee child Aylan Kurdi, whose dead body lying on the beach shocked the world after being photographed in September 2015.

The death of this young migrant girl Saturday in a tunnel on the A10 motorway linking the Bel Paese to France caused Italy watchers to reflect on the fate of so many migrants like her attempting this journey.

Many migrants who manage to reach the Italian city of Ventimiglia see it only as a stopover in their longer journey to other northern-European countries. From this city, there is a hidden internal network in place to attempt to traffic migrants into France.

Huge numbers of these immigrants, over the past two years, have tried to pass through but few actually make it -- many die on the way like the Eritrean girl, hence the name given to the motorway by the French, ‘La route e la mort.’

This ‘route’ is made up of many different roads -- the motorway, one of the most dangerous, along which Maghreb drivers attempt to take groups of migrants. There is also the railroad, where drivers of train convoys are forced to run on sight to avoid harming migrants that attempt that alternative.

Then there are the smaller rocky paths along which the African people smugglers lead migrants, by foot, with only the light of the stars to guide them across the rocks. Finally, there is the ‘Il Col de mort’ were, according to police, so many have died over the past few years -- every so often someone would slip and fall down with their body found later, many times by tourists.

The migrant smugglers charge from 200 to 250 euros per person to be taken through ‘La route de la mort.’ With the clandestine smuggling network in place, there are people to ‘welcome’ the migrants in Ventimiglia and tell them who to go to in order to be taken across to France.

The Italian border police say that the smugglers “are able to load up small vans with up to 25 people. These smugglers are generally well-integrated north Africans, often French citizens, but you can also find Bulgarians, Pakistani and Albanese smugglers.”

“Afghan smugglers tend to lead migrants only across smaller paths, the others take them in cars or show them the route to get to the A10,” said the police.

According to investigative sources, those who greet the migrants in Ventimiglia are charged with the task of “collecting bookings in the station,” and determined by the price agreed upon, they decide if their ‘customers’ are to be taken “across the motorway, the paths or in a van.”

If they are not able to pay the money, the only alternative is for the migrants to try by themselves along the A10 -- alone, by night, all too aware of the imminent risk of death.

Dicen que iban 7 en la patera, que cuatro se hundieron y que los otros tres lograron llegar a costa. Es la versión que dan argelinos del CETI que ayer comentaban a este medio que nada saben de los compañeros que decidieron coger una patera e intentar alcanzar así la península.



Los resultados de los rastreos iniciados el miércoles y continuados ayer han sido nulos. Ni la Guardia Civil ni Salvamento Marítimo han dado con los supuestos desaparecidos ni con restos de la patera que habrían robado. Tampoco se ha presentado denuncia alguna en la Comandancia de la Benemérita sobre sustracción de alguna embarcación. El colectivo argelino insiste en que el grupo partió y añade que la patera que utilizaron no tenía tapón por lo que filtraría el agua y provocó el hundimiento.



Durante la jornada de ayer unidades de ambos servicios efectuaron labores de búsqueda por la zona de la que supuestamente partió el grupo, el entorno Benítez Calamocarro, sin que se haya encontrado resto alguno.



Los argelinos denuncian la situación de discriminación que, dicen, padecen ya que no hay salidas para ellos, por lo que se ven obligados a intentar marchar por cualquier vía, aunque ésta sea arriesgada. Así lo hacen no solo ocultándose en camiones o intentando colarse debajo de los ferry, también practicando robos de embarcaciones que no están en buen estado. La Guardia Civil tiene abierta su investigación."

At one point some people started to panic. The next thing I knew I was pushed into the water and I lost my son""

ROME, Oct 13 (Reuters) - At least 17 migrants are missing after a night-time rescue of more than 100 others from a partially submerged rubber boat off the coast of Libya, the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) said on Thursday.

Italy's coastguard received a distress call from the vessel on Wednesday evening and alerted the privately funded MOAS ship Phoenix, which used remote-controlled drones to locate the boat, a statement said.

The Phoenix crew pulled 113 to safety, but survivors said it had set out from Libya with 130 on board. Among those missing was a Nigerian toddler who was about to turn 3 years old, his mother told rescuers.

""The sea was rough and the boat was taking on water. At one point some people started to panic. The next thing I knew I was pushed into the water and I lost my son in the chaos,"" the boy's mother told the Phoenix crew, MOAS said.

A young man said five of his friends were missing, and another man said a 16-year-old girl also had disappeared.

Photographs posted on the MOAS web site show that many migrants were in the water and clinging to the boat when rescuers arrived. A search for the bodies had to be abandoned due to rough seas, the statement said.

Many of those rescued suffered burns caused by leaking fuel, and one woman was in shock with first-degree burns on a third of her body, MOAS said. A medical evacuation for her had been blocked by bad weather.

Separately on Wednesday, two rescue vessels operated by MOAS and Save the Children rescued a total of 470 migrants, an Italian coastguard spokesman said.

The central Mediterranean route between North Africa and Italy is the deadliest border in the world for migrants. More than 3,100 have gone missing or died this year while trying to use this route to reach Europe by boat, the International Organization for Migration estimates.

AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

Il s'agit du premier migrant décédé dans ces conditions dans ce camp regroupant entre 150 et 200 personnes, situé à une soixantaine de kilomètres de Calais.

Tard lundi «une bagarre a éclaté entre une cinquantaine de migrants soudanais et érythréens alcoolisés», a déclaré un porte-parole de la préfecture du département du Pas-de-Calais.

«Les services de gendarmerie sont immédiatement intervenus pour mettre fin à cette rixe. Deux migrants ont été blessés et hospitalisés. L'un d'eux, retrouvé à quelques centaines de mètres du camp et dont le pronostic vital était engagé, est décédé mardi soir de ses blessures», a ajouté cette source, qui n'était pas en mesure de préciser la nationalité et l'âge de la personne décédée.

Trois migrants ont été interpellés mardi et une enquête était en cours, a-t-on appris de même source.

Selon un décompte officiel, il s'agit du 33e migrant mort depuis janvier 2015 - début de la crise migratoire - dans ce département, le plus proche des côtes anglaises.

Mais les causes des décès des migrants sont souvent liées à des accidents sur la route, notamment lorsqu'ils sont percutés la nuit par des poids-lourds en tentant d'y monter.

The bodies of 29 people who perished in a pool of fuel and seawater on a crowded dinghy off Libya have been found by the French aid group Doctors without Borders (MSF).

MSF said its chartered rescue ship, the Bourbon Argos, picked up 107 people aboard the inflatable boat 26 nautical miles off Libya on Tuesday.

Its crew initially counted 11 corpses on the dinghy’s floor, which was flooded with a murky mixture of fuel and seawater. The Bourbon Argos was then called away to another rescue operation nearby, saving 139 people aboard another vessel.

The crew returned to the dinghy and found 29 people had died, probably from suffocation, skin burns or drowning.

The bodies were retrieved from the toxic mixture over a period of hours, with the help of a team from the German NGO Sea-Watch.

“The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,” MSF project leader Michele Telaro said in a statement.

Twenty-three survivors suffered burns from exposure to fuel, 11 of whom were seriously hurt. Seven survivors were taken to hospital, two of them by helicopter.

‘H eadlong rush to the cemetery’

The find adds to the grim evidence of the hazards of crossing the Mediterranean – a journey that the UN said on Wednesday has claimed more than 3,800 lives so far this year.

To venture out to sea in such conditions, said Tefano Argenziano, in charge of MSF’s migrant assistance activities, “is a headlong rush to the cemetery”.

North America,2016-10-29,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Mexico,Central America,Mixed or unknown,United States of America,US-Mexico border crossing,"Unspecified location in the desert in New Mexico, USA",http://lat.ms/2oh25gq,3,"Back to Malinalco She begged him not to leave Mexico again. But the lure of America was powerful, and deadly

For decades, millions of Mexicans crossed into the U.S. in one of the largest mass migrations in modern history. But stricter immigration enforcement and new opportunities in Mexico have reversed the trend. Now, many are returning to towns like Malinalco, a rural community southwest of Mexico City. But coming home, it turns out, can be complicated.

On a cloudy morning last October, Agustin Poblete Ortega stopped by his wife’s house to tell her he was leaving again.

Rosa Icela Nava, then 27, didn’t want him to go.

Her whole life she had been surrounded by men who had gone north, and sometimes never returned.

And while her relationship with Poblete had been rocky over the last year — she had moved out of his family’s house because of his drinking — he was a good father to their two young daughters.

She wanted to ask him to stay, to tell him about the sick feeling in her stomach. But Nava kept her feelings inside, as was her habit.

“I can’t stop you,” she told him.

“Take care of the kids,” he said.

If Poblete was addicted to alcohol — he could never have just one tequila or beer — he was also addicted to American wages. On his five previous trips north, he had grown accustomed to earning $15 an hour. Back in his hometown of Malinalco, Mexico, he chafed as bosses handed him the equivalent of just $10 after a day of hard work.

He had been part of a large wave of Mexicans returning home in recent years, a phenomenon fueled by harsher conditions in the U.S. and new opportunities back home that is upending the immigration narrative on both sides of the border.

Coming back to Mexico is not easy for everybody. For Poblete, who had tasted the good life north of the border, the real winners in Mexico’s growing economy seemed to be the millionaire business and political leaders who arrived by helicopter to play at Malinalco’s exclusive golf resort — not high school dropouts like him.

Poblete knew that sneaking into the United States had become more dangerous than ever. Migrants died dodging immigration agents in the desert heat, drowned crossing the Rio Grande and suffocated in the back of sweltering tractor-trailers.

This is the last time. — Agustin Poblete Ortega

Yet he yearned for paychecks that would allow him to save a little, instead of just scraping by. He wanted to build a home in Malinalco for Nava and the kids and get his life on track.

“This is the last time,” he promised his younger brother before he left.

For the next nine days, Nava’s phone lighted up with messages as her husband made his way north and then waited at the border. Criminal groups were moving drugs across the desert, Poblete told her in a phone call, and his smuggler had counseled waiting till it was clear.

Then Poblete sent a message saying he would be crossing that night. “Take care of the kids,” he implored again. He told her he would call soon to say: “Hey, I made it.”

But several days passed and the phone didn’t ring.

Some of his friends figured he had been caught by immigration agents. Or assumed he had been robbed, and couldn’t call home.

Nava kept her darkest fears inside, where she kept most things. And she waited, because there was nothing else to do.

Nava was 19 years old, shy and just out of high school, when she first noticed Poblete walking down one of the city’s narrow, cobblestone streets.

Born and raised in a poor Malinalco family, Poblete, like his three brothers, had left for the United States as a young man. He had come back to Mexico to visit his family after working there on and off for more than a decade, his suitcase stuffed with a television and other gifts for his parents.

Malinalco was teeming with ex-migrants like him.

There was the taxi driver who worked for years as a coyote in Arizona, earning $200 per person to ferry migrants who had just crossed the border to cities like Atlanta, Los Angeles and Chicago. There was the man who came back from the U.S. with thousands of dollars in savings, enough to build a modest resort for vacationers visiting from Mexico City. There was the restaurant server deported from Illinois who worried about never being able to see his children again.

Ex-migrant musicians sang ballads about life in the U.S. Others formed activist groups to demand more help from the Mexican government. One was even running for governor of Mexico state, where Malinalco is located.

Poblete, like others who had come back from the U.S., was different than those who had never left. While many in this stretch of Mexico still wear boots and cowboy hats, Poblete favored long shorts, polo shirts and baseball caps. They were the kind of clothes you’d expect to see at a weekend barbecue in Georgia, where he had spent his most recent years, not in rural Mexico.

He sported just one marker of his place of birth: a drawing of the city of Malinalco tattooed on his right calf.

Nava doesn’t remember what he said the day when he first approached her on the street, but she remembers noticing how he filled a room, joking and making friends with everybody, at ease as the center of attention. Although he had been gone for years, he had many more friends than she did, and in every part of town.

He was 13 years her senior, but she was so impressed with the adventures he recounted and the flowers he brought that she didn’t think about the age difference much. Soon he was spending nights at her house and they were arguing playfully over which music to listen to — Nava’s favored cumbia, or Poblete’s beloved brassy, bouncy banda.

Four months later, Nava was pregnant. Six months after that, Poblete left her for the first time, heading north along with her sister’s husband. Both men were about to have families and wanted to earn fast cash.

Nava didn’t want him to leave. She worried that a man settled in the U.S. might forget about her. It had happened before.

She was 13 when her father had left for the U.S., part of a wave of migrants who fled Mexico in the 1990s and early 2000s because of soaring unemployment and inflation. Her dad promised to send money home and quickly return, but instead he had stayed, developed an alcohol addiction and started a whole new family.

Nava had dreamed of getting a degree in psychology, but without money to pay for university, she was forced to stop studying after high school. Her brothers couldn’t afford to continue their studies either, and both left for the U.S. to try to help the family. Only one of them came back. The other is still in Sacramento, where he has several U.S.-born children.

As her stomach grew rounder, Nava spoke to Poblete daily. He wasn’t there for the spring delivery, but they decided together to name their little girl Abril, after the month she was born.

Abril was already a year old when Poblete came home, but she took to him immediately, laughing as he tossed her in the air. Soon Nava was pregnant with another girl, Michelle.

When the money Poblete had made in the U.S. ran out, his mother hired him at the small restaurant she ran near the river on the edge of town.

She had opened the restaurant — a little stall next to a man-made pond stocked with trout — decades ago. Locals would come, catch a trout, and then have Poblete’s mother cook it for them with a little pineapple and salsa.

But now the area had transformed. After Malinalco was named a “Magic Pueblo” by the federal government, crews had paved the roads near the trout lake, and dozens of other restaurants and two water parks had opened nearby. Mexico’s expanding middle class meant that each year, more and more tourists poured into Malinalco on weekends to escape smoggy Mexico City, two hours away.

Poblete and his three brothers had grown up near the stand, earning their first pesos cleaning fresh-caught fish. After years earning much better money working in construction in Georgia, he wasn’t happy to be back.

He started spending his nights drinking with friends. If there was a party, he’d be the first to arrive. Sometimes he would show up to work so hung over he could barely take orders. Sometimes he wouldn’t show up at all.

Exasperated, his mother fired him. That’s when the downhill spiral accelerated. Poblete never hit Nava, but he was a mean drunk. She decided to move her daughters to her grandfather’s house so they wouldn’t see their father so out of control.

Not long after she moved into his house, Nava’s 85-year-old grandfather was hit by a motorcycle as he walked in Malinalco’s central plaza. That fall, he died. She was reeling from his death when Poblete came by to tell her he was leaving again.

As the days and then weeks passed with no word from him, her stomach did somersaults. She wasn’t prepared for more loss.

Day of the Dead was around the corner — time to prepare an altar for those who had died in the previous year. She was with her mother, arranging an offering of marigolds and sweet mole at an altar for her grandfather when Poblete’s mother called, hysterical, and told her the news.

She had been contacted by the Mexican Consulate in El Paso. A body had been discovered in the New Mexico desert. They believed it was Poblete’s.

The next days were a blur. Nava traveled an hour away to Toluca, the state capital, to look at photos of the body taken by the coroner’s office. She broke down. There was the tattoo of Malinalco on Poblete’s calf.

I'm afraid they'll see me cry — Rosa Icela Nava

Back home, she didn’t have the heart to tell her daughters, although they knew something was horribly wrong. Days went by without Nava coming clean, even after Abril started wetting the bed, even after one of her younger daughter’s classmates told her: “Your dad is dead.”

“I’m afraid they’ll see me cry,” Nava explained to Ellen Calmus, director of an immigrant advocacy organization that was helping her get Poblete’s body transported back to Mexico.

“Maybe seeing you cry will allow them to experience the pain,” Calmus told her. In the end, it was Calmus who told the girls what had happened.

Nava felt like there was no room for all her agony. Her mother, who had persevered after her husband made a new family, told her to concentrate on being a strong mom.

“Focus on the girls,” she said. “Your pain is huge, but their needs are greater.”

This time, Poblete came back from the U.S. in a hearse. Migrant deaths are so common, the Mexican government sets aside special funding for the dignified return of bodies.

His funeral drew 300 people to the soaring old cathedral in the center of town. Then began the somber procession toward the graveyard, about a mile away.

As the family trudged slowly to the cemetery, a band appeared. Poblete’s friends had hired it, and had brought bottles of beer. Nava was sobbing, but as the men drank and danced alongside his coffin, she knew that if Poblete was watching from somewhere, he would be happy to see that his funeral had turned into a fiesta.

For months, Nava struggled to get up in the morning. Christmas passed. Then New Year’s Day. Her daughters’ grades were plummeting, and both girls had been in trouble for fighting.

Around Easter, there was a week when Nava didn’t leave her bedroom for days.

Her mother, who had urged strength, realized her daughter needed help.

“You have to go to a doctor,” she said.

The antidepressants Nava was prescribed have helped. Now 28, she smiles more, and is more affectionate with the kids.

“I think it’s just the pills,” she said, smiling sheepishly. “But that’s OK.”

On a recent stormy afternoon, she was getting ready to finish her shift at Poblete’s mother’s restaurant, where she recently got a job serving trout and frothy piña coladas.

She had hoped to leave early to take the girls to a street festival in town. But then a large family of tourists walked in just before closing, and asked to eat. About half of them were Mexican American — U.S. citizens visiting family members who live in the area. Their legal immigration status meant they could come and go and be carefree together, drinking their piña coladas and laughing, their lives unscarred by the border.

By the time Nava arrived to pick up the girls at her mother’s house, it was dark and pouring rain. Abril was sick and had been throwing up all day.

“I’ll take her to the doctor tomorrow,” Nava said.

“You need to take her tonight,” her mother insisted.

So she took her girls by the hand and headed for the clinic, walking past the festival, where a banda group had taken the stage. The musicians wore cowboy hats and shiny red suits, and each made the sign of the cross before starting to play.

“Give me the blame, give me all of it,” the band leader wailed. The crowd swayed together under a giant tarp.

Her husband, Nava thought, would have loved it."

It is not just about luck and drawing good cards; it also depends on reading the other players, their tells, and betting patterns. The more you play poker, the better you will become at it.

The game starts with two cards being dealt to each player. The first round of betting is triggered by the mandatory bets (called blinds) that are placed into the pot by the two players to the left of the dealer. This creates an incentive for people to play and also helps establish the size of the pot that can be won by a strong hand.

After the initial betting round is complete the dealer will deal three more cards face up on the table. These are community cards that anyone can use to make a poker hand. This is called the flop and it is at this point that many players will either raise or fold their hand depending on how they perceive the odds of them having a winning hand of five cards.

Once the flop has been revealed there will be another betting round. If the flop looks promising you may want to continue raising your bets in order to increase your chances of winning the showdown. However, it is important to remember that the other players may have good hands as well and you should not be too attached to your pocket kings or queens. A strong ace on the flop can spell disaster even for these premium hands.

It is also very important to keep in mind that the position you have at the table is crucial for your success in poker. Acting last gives you a better chance to read your opponents and makes it much easier to bluff them. In addition, you will be able to make more accurate value bets when it is your turn to act.

There are a variety of strategies that can be used in poker, and the best one for you will depend on your learning style and preferences. Some players prefer to read poker strategy books while others learn by watching and playing the game. No matter how you choose to learn, the key is to find a way that works for you and stick with it. This will allow you to become a good poker player and eventually win large amounts of money!"

It remains unclear how many may have drowned along the way.

The search for answers began in early October when a shrimping boat near Port Aransas reported to the U.S. Coast Guard having found a raft with an apparent body inside. Authorities rushed to the area where they recovered a heavily decomposed body and various pieces of a raft. The remains were taken to the Nueces County Sheriff’s Office where detectives combed through missing person’s reports near the Texas coast in an attempt to identify the victim.

In an interview with Breitbart Texas, Heraldo Peña, a forensic investigator with Nueces County stated that they have not been able to get a positive ID on the body because the exposure to intense sunlight and sea water had mummified the human remains. Peña revealed that the body had a tattoo of the Virgin Mary called “our Lady of Charity of Cobre” and in the raft authorities found two Cuban identification cards.

One of the ID cards belongs to a man named Juan Antonio Pupo Pupo–while the other one belongs to his brother, Amauris Pupo Pupo. It remains unclear if the body found in the raft belongs to one of the Pupo Pupo brothers.

Federal and local authorities were not able to match the body’s fingerprints to any missing persons cases. Investigators believe the case may be tied to the disappearance of six Cubans who left the island on May 13. The missing Cubans were part of a larger group out of which six others were captured by Mexican authorities and deported back to Cuba. The body of the Cuban migrant was buried last week in a pauper’s grave in Nueces County.

Libya's coastguard said it rescued 115 migrants on Sunday who had been aboard a rubber boat that broke down off Tripoli, and that one migrant had drowned.

He said the rescue began at 7:30 am local time and it took two hours to take the migrants to Khoms port where they were given medical aid.

Around 100 people are feared drowned in the Mediterranean Sea after a dinghy capsized off Libya, according to rescue teams frantically searching for survivors in darkness and rough seas.

Rescuers and the Italian coastguard said on Tuesday that they had recovered seven bodies.

According to German NGO Jugend Rettet, which has a boat in the Mediterranean, 23 survivors had been rescued by an oil tanker which was first to reach the stricken dinghy.

Sad news from board.. Stay strong everyone! pic.twitter.com/onDawHdtok — Jugend RETTET – IUVENTA (@jugendrettet) November 15, 2016

The survivors and four of the recovered bodies were transferred from the tanker to the Aquarius, a boat operated by another charity group, SOS Mediterranee.

A survivor told one of that organisation’s staff that the dinghy had begun to sink at 6am, four hours before the arrival of the tanker.

“We were 122 on the boat, no children under 15, but there were 10 women travelling with us and only one survived,” the recued man was quoted as saying.

“We waited in the water, taking any floating thing to remain afloat, but most of the people drowned, including my little brother. He was 15.

“At 10, the tanker came and rescued us. I want to call home to tell them that my brother died.”

Attempts to find any survivors were continuing but were being hampered by very rough conditions and the chances of finding anyone alive appeared slim.

Second disaster

The latest tragedy came a day after the sinking of another dinghy in the Mediterranean.

Officials with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Tuesday that dozens of people probably died before the merchant ship reached that dinghy, which was of a type that would normally have 100-150 passengers packed on board.

INTERACTIVE: Why on earth would anyone do this?

Only 15 people managed to survive, and on Tuesday they were on board an Italilan coastguard ship en route to the Sicilian port of Catania.

Exactly how many people died will not be known until the ship’s arrival in Catania, but it would be unusual for traffickers to set sail from Libya with as few as 15 people on board.

The coastguard said a total of 298 people were rescued in three operations on Tuesday, taking the total rescued since Saturday to 2,600.

The latest deaths add to a total of 4,271 mostly African people who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year, according to the UN refugee agency.

This year is already the deadliest on record for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe, with uncertainty about the situation in conflict-torn Libya fuelling a higher number of departures in difficult weather conditions at the onset of winter."

At least 240 refugees have died in 48 hours of boat disasters in the Mediterranean Sea as asylum seekers continue desperate attempts to reach Europe in worsening weather.

Only 15 people survived one sinking off the coast of Libya on Monday, telling rescuers around 135 people who had been packed into their rubber dinghy drowned.

At least 95 others died in a second disaster on Tuesday, with just nine bodies recovered from the water so far, pushing the death toll for 2016 over 4,500.

A day rescuing refugees from the Mediterranean Sea

Survivors of the first sinking arrived on an Italian Coast Guard ship in the Sicilian port of Catania on Wednesday, where they told the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) of their ordeal

“The survivors told us that there were about 150 people on board, so there would be about 135 missing,” spokesperson Iosta Ibba told AFP.

On Tuesday, an oil tanker was dispatched by Italian commanders to another capsized dinghy and rescued 23 of more than 120 people who had set out from Libya.

They were plucked out of the water and transferred to the Aquarius humanitarian ship run by SOS Mediterranée and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to be taken to Italy.

Jugend Rettet, a German NGO, said its vessel had been recovered dead bodies from the water but the vast majority of refugees killed in boat disasters are never found or identified.

A survivor told a member of SOS Mediterranée staff that the dinghy had begun to sink at 6am, four hours before the tanker arrived.

People smugglers have continued to launch overcrowded boats from the Libyan coast despite worsening weather conditions, seeing a string of tragedies in recent weeks.

Also on Tuesday, the Aquarius was called to a deflating refugee dinghy off the coast of Libya that had been at sea for 12 hours.

Rescuers arrived to find the boat filled with water and sinking, with panicking refugees jumping into the water including one person who the team could not prevent from drowning.

Five dead bodies were found on the boat and a 10-year-old boy and a woman had to be evacuated by helicopter for emergency medical attention, while 114 survivors were treated for hypothermia, fuel inhalation and chemical burns.

Three children under the age of five, 21 minors and eight women were among the saved passengers.

The refugee crisis has made the passage from Libya to Italy the deadliest in the deadliest in the world, claiming the vast majority of more than 4,300 lives lost in treacherous sea crossings to Europe so far this year.

It is the highest number on record, with analysts warning that EU anti-smuggling missions have driven people smugglers to pack refugees into ever smaller and less seaworthy boats to evade detection.

The Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS), a rescue charity, said efforts in the Mediterranean were becoming more challenging than ever, with humanitarian efforts overwhelmed by the changing tactics of smuggling networks.

The group said gangs appeared to be “industrialising” to meet demand as conflict and lawlessness continues in Libya, where asylum seekers report being detained, extorted and tortured before they are forced on to overcrowded boats.

“The combination of heavier loads and inferior quality is a recipe for disaster”, said MOAS head of operations Ian Ruggier. “There is no doubt that the vessels are built to last a few miles to see people beyond Libyan territorial waters.”

The group said the true death toll is almost certainly far higher than the recorded figure as many boat sinkings are feared to be unrecorded, and bodies washed back on to Libya’s shores are not routinely counted.

It is among several humanitarian groups calling on EU countries to provide safe passage for refugees trying to reach safety, such as resettlement programmes and visas, but political will has waned as anti-immigration parties continue to gain popularity.

Charities are additionally warning of dire conditions at overwhelmed reception and detention centres in Italy and Greece, but several nations, including the UK, are not taking part in a quota system for those who have already landed in Europe.

More than 340,200 migrants and asylum seekers have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, with the crossing from Libya becoming the dominant route since the controversial EU-Turkey deal was implemented to stop arrivals over the Aegean Sea.

Around a quarter of those arriving are Syrian, followed by Afghans, Nigerians, Iraqis, Eritreans and other nationalities across Africa, the Middle East and Asia."

DHAKA - Around 200 Rohingya Muslims fleeing a surge in violence after security forces took control of Myanmar's Rakhine state last month are stranded at the Bangladesh border, community leaders said Tuesday.

The northen part of Myanmar's Rakhine state has been under military lockdown for almost a month after deadly raids on three police border posts.

Bangladeshi border guards pushed back the Rohingya -- mostly women and children -- to the Myanmar side on Monday, community leaders told AFP.

""We heard they are 200 in number. They are mostly women and children who were only seeking a safe place to stay. They have no homes to go back,"" one of the Rohingya leaders told AFP from a refugee camp in Bangladesh's Teknaf border town.

A border guard spokesman put the figure at closer to 80.

Nearly 70 people have died in clashes with security forces since the Myanmar army swooped into Rakhine state, an area along the border with Bangladesh that is home to the Muslim Rohingya minority.

Violence escalated over the weekend, with troops killing more than 30 people in two days of fighting, according to the Myanmar army.

Activists say the actual toll could be much higher, accusing troops of killing civilians, raping women and torching homes -- allegations the army denies.

Authorities have heavily restricted access to the area, making it difficult to independently verify government reports or accusations of army abuse.

The stranded Rohingya crossed the Naf River -- which divides the two countries -- by boats in the early hours of Monday and were immediately sent back by Bangladeshi border guards.

""We have stopped and pushed back around 80 Rohingya people yesterday (Monday),"" border guard spokesman, Major Abu Russell Siddique, told AFP.

He said the Rohingya who were pushed back were economic migrants ""looking for work and treatment"", and denied the community leaders' claim that they were victims of recent violence in Rakhine.

Another border guard commander told AFP that Monday's group was the largest number of Rohingya pushed back since violence erupted in early October.

Nineteen-year-old Mohammad Towhid told AFP by phone that he also crossed in the early hours of Monday, but managed to avoid the border guards.

""They (Myanmar army) shot dead my sister before my eyes. I hid underneath heaps of cow dung during the attack. As the night fell, I rushed to the border,"" Towhid said, speaking from a Teknaf refugee camp.

""I left my mother alone at home. I don't know whether she survived or not,"" he said, adding that troops had torched hundreds of Rohingya homes.

The UN has labelled the Rohingya as one of the world's most persecuted peoples.

They are branded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh by Myanmar's majority Buddhist population despite their long roots in the country, where they face apartheid-like restrictions on movement and are denied citizenship.

But the Bangladeshi government also refuses to register the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees living on its side of the border."

Europe,2016-11-16,1.0,,1,,1.0,,,Eritrea,Eastern Africa,Vehicle accident / death linked to hazardous transport,Italy,,"Near the Borghetto station at the border between Veneto and Trentino, Italy",http://bit.ly/2uLtXwa,4,"Andrea Quadroni & Michele Luppi

After our reports dedicated to Ventimiglia and Como, we close our trilogy on fatal incidents and pushbacks at those Italian locations where migrants cannot cross into other countries: France, Switzerland, and, in this case, Austria, where a general election is scheduled for October 15, the xenophobic far-right is on the rise, and the government is butting heads with Italy and using anti-immigration rhetoric during the campaign. Amid internal memos, shakedowns on trains, and steep mountain passes, Michele Luppi and Andrea Quadroni went to investigate the impact of this all on people’s lives.

It took weeks of research – and the kind of work that maybe others should have done – to discover the identity of the young woman who died on November 16 last year near the Borghetto station at the border between Veneto and Trentino. She was walking along the tracks when she was hit by a local train headed to Verona. We know now that her name was Rawda, that she was 29 years old, and had arrived in Italy less than ten days earlier. She had on her the badge for one of Milan’s main reception centres for migrants in transit, indicating that she was trying to find a way to travel north after landing in Reggio Calabria.

This story was told to Open Migration by Alessandra Volani of Antenne Migranti, a project that tracks and monitors migrant flow along the Brenner route. Alessandra is one of the research leaders together with Valentina Sega and Zabenay Jabe Daka, an Ethiopian citizen and member of a regional association called Amici dell’Etiopia (Friends of Ethiopia). “We realised immediately,” Alessandra recounts, “that all attempts by the authorities to identify the woman and notify her family had effectively ceased. The city of Avio had actually already begun preparations for her burial though the body had not even been given a name and the family had not been informed.”

The turning point in this story came in the form of a coincidence combined with the determination of many ordinary citizens. During a visit to the mortuary in Avio on November 25, Alessandra Volani discovered a bag near the body of the woman, which contained the few belongings she had had on her at the time of her death. “Inside it,” Alessandra explains, “we found some notes written in Amharic that we translated with Zabenay’s help.”

Following several calls to Ethiopia to the numbers found in the note, they were able to finally contact the woman’s father, and they also discovered that Rawda had a daughter. Thanks to the work of Valentina and many others, the entire town, including the parish and the Ethiopian community, then got involved. A fundraising campaign was launched, which collected 11,000 euros, enough to fly the body back to Ethiopia and give Rawda’s family and daughter a bit of support. On January 20, almost two months after the discovery, Rawda’s body was back home.

However, many questions remain, the most nagging one being what led the woman to walk along the tracks in the first place. It is believed that she was forced to step off a train at the Borghetto station following a police check and that, finding herself in an unfamiliar area at night, she had chosen to walk all the way back to Verona.

Border casualties

Four migrants have died along the Brenner route since November 2016: three more shared Rawda’s fate, all of them Eritreans. A man and a woman were found dead on December 3 aboard a freight train at the station of Wörgl, in the Austrian Tyrol, a few kilometres from the German border. The train carrying heavy vehicles had left the night before from Verona. A third man who was travelling with them was hospitalised in Innsbrück in serious condition. The incident was reported on the website of the Tiroler Tageszeitung, and is thought to have occurred during unloading operations; the man and the woman, probably unconscious from exposure, were accidentally crushed to death by a truck.

This incident, as Reuters reported, led the Austrian authorities to redouble searches on all freight trains in transit between Italy and Germany in order to find any stowaways.

A few days earlier in Bolzano, on November 21, 17-year old Abel Temesgen was killed while attempting to climb onto a train at the station’s freight yard. “His story is emblematic,” Anna Brambilla from ASGI told Open Migration a few months ago, “of the many omissions facing unaccompanied minors: he was refused entrance at the camp for adult migrants in Messina after giving conflicting statements regarding his age (16, then 21), he then travelled through Rome and the Milan hub, was stopped by the police in Bolzano, was killed by a train just outside the city, and eventually certified as a minor only after his death.”

These deaths show that trains are still the chief means of transport for migrants trying to cross the border, but not the only one. Since controls have been intensified not only at Brenner station but along the entire railway line from Verona, people have increasingly been trying to find new ways to cross, including buses with international service to countries like Germany, such as Flixibus, as well as smaller services operating on minor passes such as Malles.

The road to the north, interrupted

Today, at Brenner there are no all-terrain vehicles with the Austrian coat of arms, no military vehicles, no migrants camping, no families trying to cross into Austria and Germany, no sleeping bags being passed out in the railway station. On the other hand, the police, the Carabinieri, and the Alpini are thoroughly searching all passing trains in both directions. Because of border cooperation, this practice has been common for some time along the routes that connect Tyrol to South Tyrol through Brenner. The tension among law enforcement officers at the station, however, is palpable, maybe in part due to recent statements by the Austrian authorities who have raised their voice against Italy over immigration issues (the same thing is happening at Tarvisio). Local and Intercity trains in both directions are being searched by about ten officers, though only two or three actually board the carriages. “In fact, for a few months now patrol officers have been boarding as early as Verona, Trento, Bolzano, or Eisack,” Federica Dalla Pria, coordinator for Antenne Migranti, explained. “The officers are meticulous, asking for identification, stopping people, checking that there are no stowaways. As a consequence, the number of people arriving in Brenner has decreased sharply.”

Those who are stopped are taken off the trains and brought to the transit police station and the border post. According to Antenne Migranti, those headed for Austria are put on trains to Bolzano; some, but not all, are handed a piece of paper ordering them to go to police headquarters. Unaccompanied minors are handed over to the Volontarius operators who run a reception centre in the small Alpine village.

Trapped in Bolzano

2015 – when the border to the north was the busiest one, especially for those coming from the Balkans (mostly Syrian, Afghan, and Pakistani refugees) – seems like a long time ago. According to data from the Ministry cited by Melting Pot (the media outlet which also uncovered racial profiling in searches on trains), during the first three months of 2016 about 800 illegal foreign nationals were stopped and 150 people voluntarily sent back from the border in Tarvisio and Brenner combined. It is hard to say whether the trend is stable or rising.

Tyrol police chief Helmut Tomac recently said, “about twenty migrants are found and sent back every day.” The search is not limited to the Italian side of the Brenner route. With the arrival of spring, there was a considerable increase in patrol operations even on the mountain passes, and there have been reports of people being caught and then sent back to Italy. For instance, in Bolzano, between late 2015 and early 2016, about 350 migrants were staying in the park near the station. The authorities addressed the situation in late September 2016 with a memo from Department Director for Social Policy, Luca Ciritelli – which basically revokes reception for anyone, no matter how vulnerable, who arrived in Italy seeking asylum without being sent directly by the Ministry.

It appears that under the new regulations (that many suspects are unlawful) for families, only mothers and children under 14 can be taken in. Fathers and other adult family members are excluded unless the man is the only adult member of the family. Caritas director Paolo Valente did not mince words: “Under these regulations, families are split and people are being left out on the streets, especially women with children or pregnant women and minors over 14, fleeing from desperate conditions. It’s unacceptable.”

Ten months on and with tightened security along the entire route, the numbers in Bolzano are going down. Nevertheless, between asylum seekers (mostly Pakistani and Afghans) and people who were not granted protection (mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa), about 150 people have been forced to sleep in makeshift shelters. Add to these about 50 migrants who have arrived over the last few weeks, some of whom only stay for a few days.

In Piazza Verdi, volunteers from Sos Bozen – with supplies from Médecins Sans Frontières – are distributing blankets, sleeping bags, and hygiene kits; from a trailer in the same space, Volontarius and Cooperativa San Vincenzo are serving dinner. “If we were any closer to the border, we’d be like Ventimiglia. Many are arriving here by Flixibus now, and they try to cross not just on trains, but also through the mountain passes. We even know of people who made it, but they are the exception,” explained Sos Bozen Karim Cirimbelli, who has called on the city to open a centre for migrants in transit like the ones in Como and Ventimiglia. After all, following recent arrivals by sea, Bolzano is expecting a spike in the number of migrants by the end of the summer. Let’s hope that there won’t be any more dead to mourn on the mountains here in this corner of Italy.

Six people were killed and another three went missing on Nov. 18 when a boat carrying migrants capsized off the coast of Turkey’s Didim in the Aegean province of Aydın, Doğan News Agency has reported.The fiber boat, carrying 13 Syrian migrants bound for Greek islands, reportedly capsized off the Turkish coast due to bad weather conditions.Locals immediately informed the authorities of the incident.Six migrants died and four were rescued from the sea, as coast guard units’ efforts to rescue three missing migrants were ongoing.On Nov. 15, coast guard units had caught a total of 40 Syrians attempting to cross over to Greece from Didim.That marked the first such incident in a long time after the migrant deal between Turkey and the European Union.According to the deal reached on March 18, for every irregular migrant who reached the EU via Turkey, who Turkey vowed to take back, the EU would take the same amount of Syrian refugees directly from refugee camps in Turkey.The EU also vowed to grant Turkey a total of 6 billion euros to be used for Syrian refugees in the country, while also granting visa-free travel to Turkish citizens inside the EU’s Schengen zone, on grounds that Ankara fulfills all of the 72 criteria needed.This visa liberalization process is yet to be realized and remains a sticking point in already tense EU-Turkey relations."

Only a few months have passed since the closure of the French border at Ventimiglia, but the decision has already caused 12 fatal accidents. Drowned, run over, fallen, and electrocuted, migrants keep dying in their attempts to cross the border or get lost and hurt themselves in dangerous places. This is the first of three reportages by Michele Luppi and Andrea Quadroni about border deaths and includes an interactive map of the places where they have been killed.

His name was Alfatehe-Ahmed Bachire, he was 17 years old, and he came from Sudan. He is the latest dead migrant at the French-Italian border, drowning at the mouth of the Roja river on June 13. Some witnesses report that he was simply attempting to retrieve a shoe in the water, an accident with a tragic outcome. According to Intersos, the NGO that provides healthcare and legal aid to those migrants outside the reception system in Ventimiglia, his death is not a simple fatality. Rather, it is a consequence of the utter degradation in which those who came here to cross the border have been living for months.

“Our government cannot close its eyes to this deeply unfair death,” Cesare Fermi of Intersos says, “because it is the result of the persistent and shameful degradation of the area around Ventimiglia. A critical situation that has been deliberately worsened by a policy based on militarisation, repression, and rejection. On the French side, the Border Police arbitrarily refouling minors, and roundups and deportations on the Italian one.”

This is not the first migrant death in the river running through Ventimiglia. On November 21, 2016, a man was swept away by the current; his body has never been found. A total of 11 migrants have died at the border between Italy and France since September 2016: eight of them were killed in their attempt to cross it, three died while they were still in Ventimiglia. Besides the two victims mentioned above, another migrant was hit by a scooter on January 4, 2017, near the Red Cross accommodation centre in Ventimiglia’s Parco Roja. The Italian driver lost his life in the accident as well.

According to the statements of the border police during the press conference on the eve of the G7 summit in Taormina, 17,048 refoulements were carried out in 2016 at the border crossings of Ponte San Ludovico, Ponte San Luigi, Olivetta San Michele and Fanghetto, at the Ventimiglia railway station, and at the A10 motorway gate.

“The French government decided to reintroduce border checks on June 11, 2015,” says Maurizio Marmo, director of the Caritas in Ventimiglia-Sanremo. “This is the third summer in a row and, compared to the same period last year, numbers have doubled.”

The Red Cross camp accommodates about 300 migrants, but far more live in the city. About one hundred women together with children under the age of 16 have found shelter in the Church of S. Antonio in the neighbourhood of Gianchette. Many other migrants, around 300 or 400, spent a number of weeks in an informal camp on the Roja riverbed until June 26. On that date, the municipality of Ventimiglia ordered the evacuation of the area and fear pushed a group of about 400 refugees to set out all together towards France. Most of them were caught by the French authorities in the following hours and readmitted to Italy. Over one hundred were taken by bus to the hotspot in Taranto.

According to Antonio Suetta, Bishop of Ventimiglia, “these kind of situations expose migrants to major risks, and over the last few months have even claimed some victims. My main concern is what will happen to foreign unaccompanied minors, a group that represents a large part of the refugees in Ventimiglia. They should receive proper accommodation.”

In addition to those who have lost their lives, dozens of migrants have been wounded, some of them as young as Yasir, a 20-year-old from Sudan. When we meet him along the Roja river, his foot is noticeably bandaged. “I hurt myself three days ago,” he says, “on one of the paths that lead to France. I had already crossed the border when the police saw me. I tried to run away but I slipped on a heap of stones and got injured. Then they caught me and took me back to the border.”

Border deaths

On March 21, the French newspaper Nice-Matin reported the finding of a dead migrant on the French side of the mountain. Two days before, a guest had been noticed missing at Parco Roja but searches on the Italian side had been unsuccessful. His body was retrieved along the Grimaldi track, at the border between Menton and Ventimiglia, one of the crossing points used by migrants. It is referred to as the “death pass” because of its roughness; in the past, it was secretly used by antifascists and smugglers to cross the border.

“The dead body was found after several days and we cannot rule out the possibility of other victims we don’t know about,” Maurizio Marmo says. “Unfortunately, the track has many forks, and if you don’t know the way, you could end up on the edge of a ravine.”

On September 6, 2016, a young African boy trying to evade the border police and whose name is still unknown fell off a viaduct on the A8 motorway outside Menton near the village of Sainte-Agnès. One month later, on October 9, the 17-year-old Eritrean girl Milet Tesfamariam was hit by a truck at the French border on the A10. She was walking with some of her relatives through the tunnel after the Ventimiglia gate, just before French territory. The driver declared that he saw the group of migrants crossing the road and tried to slam on the brakes, but was unable to avoid the girl.

Less than two weeks later, on October 21, the French newspapers reported that another young migrant was hit by a car headed for Italy on the A8 near Menton. “According to the police,” Le Parisien read, “the presence of several people on this stretch of the motorway that leads from Italy to France had already been reported at the beginning of the night. Some of them were found and taken to the border police.”

Dangerous trains

Although migrants are increasingly caught trying to cross the border on foot, over the last ten months, trains have continued to cause the greatest number of casualties. On December 23, in the town of Latte, near Ventimiglia, a local train bound for Nice ran over a group of migrants walking towards France along the Ventimiglia-Menton lines. A 25-year-old boy from Algeria ended up on the ballast and died instantly.

The Mediapart report reveals that, in accordance with the procedure of the French railway company Sncf, in cases of accidents involving other people, the engine driver has to stop, get off to inspect the tracks, and inform the block post. At that point, traffic must be interrupted until police and first-aiders intervene. Furthermore, it is a winding route, with unlit tunnels and very poor visibility. A train needs from 300 to 800 metres to stop completely. This is why many accidents happen in the dark: border crossings are more frequent early in the morning or at the end of the day.

Daniela Zitarosa, legal operator of Intersos, explains, “Friday is one of the most stressful days because it’s market day and many French come to Ventimiglia to go shopping. Migrants try to take advantage of the confusion to get on the trains.” Some of them hide under the seats, in the banker, or in more dangerous places: electrical rooms, gangways, tool cabinets. Others try to enter France by walking along the railway tracks. On February 5, a migrant was hit in the Dogana tunnel, the last one before the border, by a local French train headed for Italy. The victim was with other migrants. Twelve days later, at the Cannes-La Bocca railway station, the dead body of an African man was found on the roof of a train; he had been electrocuted and was stuck in the pantograph, the device that connects trains and trams to the overhead high-voltage wires. On May 20, at the same railway station, the Sncf cleaning personnel found the electrocuted body of a 30-year-old from Mali in the small electrical room of a local Ter train.

Following all these deaths, the French railway company drew up an informative flyer warning people of the risks, and have asked the associations operating in Ventimiglia to help distribute it. In this way, they hope to prevent further deadly accidents.

Nameless dead

The number of the dead is not the only shocking thing at the border of Italy and France. It is also very difficult to find information about the victims and the current location of their corpses. As Marmo explains: “Unfortunately, most of the migrants died in France and we don’t know whether or not they were buried and, if they were, how. From this point of view, it’s hard for us to have an overview of the situation.”

But there is one person in particular every one remembers with special fondness at the Church of S. Antonio – the positive symbol of the city’s reception of migrants. Milet Tesfamariam, the 17-year-old Eritrean girl hit by a truck on October 9, was one of the twenty thousand migrants the church has accommodated since its opening on May 31, 2016. “We celebrated her funeral on October 15, here in the same church where she slept the night before she died,” Father Rito Alvarez says. “Dozens of migrants attended, most of them Eritrean, but there were also a lot of Italian and French volunteers as well as normal citizens.” Among them was Milet’s cousin who lives in Rome and came here in order to identify the body. The parish even organised a collection to raise the five thousand euros for the body to be repatriated. “It seemed the least we could do to restore her dignity,” the priest says.

The funeral was also attended by Antonio Suetta, the Bishop of Ventimiglia, who gave a harsh homily (the second part of which is available here): “Milet is a victim of the unfair regime of her country from which she escaped. A country everyone knows, but no one cares about. Milet is a victim of our borders–as legal as they are unfair–when they’re closed in people’s faces and inexorably shut before their cries for help. Milet is the victim of a society which claims to be civilized, which parades principles like brotherhood, freedom, and equality, but where people are persecuted and killed in the name of those principles. A society that has proven unable to apply these principles impartially, where some are more of a brother, freer, and more equal than others. Our civilization should be ashamed of this injustice. Milet is a victim of the piles of files that lie for too long on the desks of those in charge, of the unfair procedures that fail to do justice to the poor asking for help.”

UPDATED: shortly after this article was published in its original Italian version, we received news of a twelfth death: a migrant whose nationality is still unknown who was run over and killed by a truck in Latte (as reported on the map).



*UPDATED: sadly, more deadly incidents are being reported in the area of Ventimiglia: on May 24, 2017 a man from Senegal was found dead, he too electrocuted in the electrical room of a French train that had left from Ventimiglia. On August 16, 2017, a 36-year old Iraqi migrant died hit by a train at the mouth of the tunnel in the Puglia zone in Ventimiglia.

The consul, Lilian Gomez, held up a picture of a young, dark-haired woman. “Her brother is calling us every week to ask if you have the DNA results.”

The brother had seen a picture of a body on a Facebook page that aimed to identify missing migrants and become convinced the dead woman was his sister.

“It’s not her,” Stern said, comparing the two pictures. She sighed and shook her head. “This person is much older. The nose is different. The ears are different. One has curly hair and one has straight.” Stern knew the two photos didn’t match, and she also knew that grief did funny things to people’s minds.

They moved on to another case, and another. After two hours, Gomez picked up the last folder and stared at it for a moment. “This one — this one I don’t know what to do with,” she said.

“We still have him here?” asked Stern.

“Yes.” Gomez explained: The case had dragged on for months. A crosser brought to Stern’s office matched the description of a missing Honduran man. The dental records showed a match, but the family wanted more proof. Stern brought in a forensic dentist who told them the match was beyond question. The family still didn’t believe their son could be dead, and so they were refusing to claim his remains.

“I am a Christian, I do believe in spiritual things,” Gomez said. “But the family called a lady in California.”

“A psychic?” Stern asked.

“They called a psychic. She tells them, your son is still alive. He is working on a ranch with 20 other people.”

Stern shook her head. “But if that was the case, why wouldn’t he call them?”

“Yes, exactly,” Gomez said.

Stern told Gomez that she wanted to be able to send him home. But she understood that hope also did funny things to people. In the face of relentless sadness, a family might choose to believe something that went against the facts of the situation. They talked about giving the family more time. “I can give them closure,” she said to Gomez, finally. “But I take away their hope.”"

Seven migrant corpses were found on board a dinghy off Malta yesterday afternoon, while one of two men who survived a sea ordeal died at Mater Dei Hospital.

When contacted, an Armed Forces of Malta spokesman confirmed that two migrants, who were found severely dehydrated, had been rescued and were airlifted off the dinghy to Mater Dei hospital. However, this morning a hospital source confirmed one of the two men had died and the other is in intensive care.

The boat was spotted around 100 miles south west off between Malta. The rescue operation, which started at 5pm, included a Frontex vessel.

The identity of the victims and the survivors and the circumstances which led to the tragedy is not yet known.

It is also not known where the bodies of the victims will be taken.

More than 4,600 people are estimated to have died in the Mediterranean in 2016, according to the latest International Organisation for Migration report, compared to 3,777 in 2015. Tens of thousands more have been rescued, several by the AFM and the Malta-based Migrant Offshore Aid Station."

Dozens have been reported missing, feared drowned, after a boat packed with Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar and trying to reach Bangladesh sank in a border river, according to the AFP news agency.

A Bangladeshi fisherman told AFP that he had rescued on Monday one woman, who told him that the “overcrowded” boat had sunk in the Naf river, after it was chased by a Myanmar army speedboat.

“We heard a woman’s desperate cry for help in the morning while we were fishing in the Naf. We quickly paddled to the spot and saw she was fighting to stay afloat,” fisherman Suman Das said by phone.

Watch: Is the world ignoring the plight of the Rohingya?

“The woman told us that their boat was overcrowded with Rohingya villagers who tried to cross the river to enter Bangladesh.”

The woman did not know what had happened to the others, and Das could not say how many people were on the boat.

But the private UNB news agency, quoting a Bangladeshi village councillor, said there were at least 31 Rohingya on board.

A Rohingya source told AFP by phone that the bodies of 13 women and children, two of whom had bullet wounds, had washed ashore in his village on Myanmar’s side of the Naf.

This could not be independently confirmed, however, and Bangladesh police and border guards said they were not aware of the incident.

An estimated 30,000 Rohingya have been forced to leave their homes since a bloody October crackdown by the Myanmar army in the western Rakhine state, where many of them live.

At least 10,000 have arrived in Bangladesh, the United Nations said last week, although Bangladesh said it has prevented large numbers from entering.

Myanmar has denied allegations of abuse, but has also banned foreign journalists and independent investigators from accessing the area to investigate."

More than 40 people were rescued off the Yemeni island of Socotra on Wednesday after a cargo vessel carrying islanders home from the mainland sank in the Indian Ocean, authorities said.

Several others were still missing after a major search operation in the early hours, President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi said in a statement on the official sabanew.net website.

The official Saba news agency said that 42 people, including four women, had been rescued ""and the search is continuing for 20 missing.""

About 20 people were still missing and 42 were rescued after a shipwreck in the Indian Ocean off the Yemeni island of Socotra, seen in 2008 ©KHALED FAZAA (AFP/File)

The ship sank northwest of Socotra -- around 350 kilometres (220 miles) from Yemen's south coast -- which has been hit by rare tropical cyclones in recent months.

Hadi called for ""doubling efforts to broaden rescue operations to reduce the scope of the catastrophe that has struck the inhabitants of Socotra.""

Officials declined to say if inclement weather was behind the disaster but Yemeni Fisheries Minister Fahd Kavieen earlier told reporters that the vessel had ""an accident"".

The government said United Arab Emirates jets were assisting search and rescue operations alongside Yemeni coastguards as well as two ships from Australia and Austria. Saba said at least two passengers had been rescued by these vessels.

Although long ruled from Yemen, Socotra lies closer to the coast of Africa than it does to the Arabian Peninsula.

It sits at the exit of a busy shipping lane from the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean.

For years it was prey to piracy from the lawless Somali coast and it is in one of the most heavily patrolled maritime areas on Earth.

Kavieen did not specify whether warships of the international counter-piracy operation were taking part in the search for survivors.

He said that the ship had been out of contact for several days and its sinking was confirmed on Tuesday.

""Vessels have been combing the area since the early hours and there is significant hope that the passengers have survived,"" he said.

Yemen has been ravaged by conflict for the past two years, disrupting transport links to the Socotra archipelago.

The port of Mukalla, from which the sunken freighter set off, was controlled by Al-Qaeda for a full year until it was retaken by pro-government forces in April.

Air links to Socotra from elsewhere in Yemen have all but ground to a halt as Hadi's beleaguered government battles rebels who still control the capital Sanaa.

There are no regular passenger ferries either, forcing islanders to seek berths on the occasional cargo vessel.

Throughout the devastating conflict that has pitted forces supporting Hadi against Shiite rebels and their allies, Socotra has remained loyal to his Saudi-backed government and has been spared the violence gripping much of Yemen.

- Tourism potential -

Socotra has enormous tourism potential which has never been realised because of the repeated conflicts suffered by Yemen.

Its isolation from the landmasses of both Africa and Asia has led to the evolution of unique plant life, much of it found nowhere else on Earth.

Among the most famous is the dragon's blood tree, a bizarre umbrella-shaped plant that earned its name from its blood-red sap which was much sought after as a dye in the ancient world.

Persistent unrest in the nearby Horn of Africa has meant that the waters around Socotra have seen a steady flow of Ethiopian and Somali migrants ready to risk the perilous sea crossing in the hope of reaching Yemen's energy-rich Gulf neighbours."

The man was allegedly shot by Myanmar army on Sunday.

The victim is Shah Alam, 47, of Mangala village in Myanmar's Mongdhu.

Talking to journalists, his sister Fatema Begum, 40, said a group of armed Rakhine youths and Myanmar army surrounded their Mangala village around 6:00pm on Sunday and asked the people who were at home at that time to come out of their homes.

The army personnel shot her brother Alam after she and her brother had come out of their house. With bullet wounds, her brother was heading towards a nearby forest to take shelter there, but fell on the ground on the way. She also followed her brother, Fatema said.

When the attackers left the village, she and her brother reached near the Naf river with the help of some villagers to enter Bangladesh.

At the dead of night, they along with two others crossed the river by a boat and entered Bangladesh through Damdamia point of Teknaf's Hnila.

They later took shelter at the shanty of her sister Romita Begum, 35, who has been living in the Leda unregistered Rohingya camp for eight years, said Fatema.

Amir Hossain, general secretary of the camp management committee, said Alam came to the camp in a very critical condition yesterday morning and he died there later.

Sheikh Ashrafuzzaman, inspector (investigation) of Teknaf Police Station, said police recovered the body and sent it to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital morgue for an autopsy."

Two overcrowded inflatable dinghies capsized in the Strait of Sicily after leaving Libya for Italy, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN refugee agency UNHCR said.

""Those two incidents together appear to be the numbers that would bring this year's total up to over to 5,000 (deaths), which is a new high that we have reported during this crisis,"" IOM spokesman Joel Millman told a Geneva briefing.

UNHCR spokesman William Spindler said the ""alarming increase"" in deaths this year appeared to be related to bad weather, the declining quality of vessels used by smugglers, and their tactics to avoid detection.

""These (reasons also) include sending large numbers of embarkations simultaneously, which makes the work of rescuers more difficult,"" he said

The UNHCR appealed to states to open up more legal pathways for admitting refugees. Resettlement programmes, private sponsorship, family reunification and student scholarships would help ""so they do not have to resort to dangerous journeys and the use of smugglers"", Spindler said.

The overall number of refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants counted in Serbia stood around 7,700. Over 6,600 (86%) of them were sheltered in 17 heated government facilities (below chart refers). The rest were staying rough in Belgrade city centre or the North.

A second tragic death by hypothermia of a refugee/migrant during this winter was confirmed. Both victims had been abandoned by smugglers in the hills/woods near the Serbian-Bulgarian border. After a woman from Iraq died close to the border with Bulgaria in mid-December, authorities now retrieved the body of a man from Pakistan near Pirot, who had gone missing at the end of January. The authorities assisted with the transfer of his remains to relatives in Western Europe.

Efforts to resolve the situation of refugee/migrant men and boys squatting in Belgrade city centre progressed.

UNHCR continued supporting the rapid refurbishment of capacities in the Obrenovac centre. Small groups of men and boys used governmental transport from the city centre, while some also went to Obrenovac spontaneously, requesting accommodation. Now Obrenovac accommodates 765 refugee/migrant men, including 345 boys. Accordingly, fewer men and boys appear to be sleeping rough in Belgrade city centre. At the same time, UNHCR and partners transported 36 newly registered asylum seekers from Belgrade city centre to asylum centres.

Hungarian authorities admitted 19 asylum seekers into procedures at the Hungarian “transit zones” near Kelebija and Horgos border crossings. During the same period, over 70 asylum-seekers informed UNHCR and partners to have been denied access to asylum procedures in Hungary but instead been collectively expelled back into Serbia, with some alleging maltreatment by Hungarian police. As per its global protection mandate,

UNHCR also continues following up on reports of unlawful expulsion of asylum-seekers from Serbia to Bulgaria and FYR Macedonia."

The treacherous and ultimately futile journey by 80, mostly Senegalese migrants, had begun in Sabratha in western Libya three days earlier, one survivor recounted.

After setting off, the boat was buffeted by rough seas and eventually ran aground on a beach in Tripoli some 70 kilometres to the east.

“We thought we had already arrived in Italy,” one of the survivors said.

Witnesses said several people had jumped from the boat to try to reach the beach but were unable to swim and drowned.

Those who made it to the shore alive included two women -- one pregnant -- and a child, and they were all in shock.

The pregnant woman sat in tears on the beach next to what was believed to be the body of her brother. She was later hospitalised.

The Libyan Red Crescent said it had recovered the bodies of five passengers from the beach on Wednesday and taken 80 people to shelters.

Forty-five illegal sub-Saharan Africans were rescued and three bodies, including a child, were fished out on Wednesday after their inflatable boat capsized off the coast of the north-eastern city of Nador, local authorities said.

Moroccan authorities have launched an investigation on this incident under the supervision of the public prosecutor's office.

Tens of thousands of sub-Saharan African migrants living illegally in Morocco try to reach Europe every year, hoping to get a better life.

Figures suggest that illegal immigrants arriving in Spain via Morocco have dropped by 90 percent since 2002.

Over the past few years, Morocco has adopted a strict policy against illegal migrants to Europe, but opened a door for regularizing their status in the country.

In last December, Morocco launched the second phase of the regularization of illegal immigrants in the country, after the first phase led to granting about 25,000 people legal status."

Snow fell in parts of the Middle East on Wednesday as a powerful winter storm swept through the region, killing two Syrian refugees in Lebanon and forcing thousands who have fled their country's civil war to huddle for warmth in tents in refugee camps.

In Syria, the guns fell silent as snow fell in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo and government warplanes remained on the ground because of bad visibility.

The storm dumped rain and hail on Lebanon's coast and heavy snows in the mountains and central Bekaa Valley. Gas stations, schools, banks and shops shuttered and power was cut throughout Lebanon, but it was particularly trying for the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees who live in tents and makeshift shelters.

In eastern Lebanon, security officials said a Syrian shepherd, Ammar Kamel, 30, and a seven-year-old boy, Majed Badawi, died in the storm Wednesday as they made the dangerous trek through the rugged, snow-covered mountains from Syria to the Lebanese border town of Chebaa. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Near the town of Anjar, on the border with Syria, refugees used brooms and sticks to try to clear heavy snow from the tops of their tents, fearing the shelters would collapse. Inside, adults huddled around wood-burning stoves to try to keep warm.

In Beirut's slum of Shatila, residents waded through dirty water and floating garbage that clogged the narrow alleys while children played, trying to catch hail.

Ibtisam Mohammed, a 37-year-old mother of seven, managed to get her rusting diesel stove working again on Wednesday, in an effort to warm her home. The wind had ripped away the plastic sheet used for windows and water dripped on the floor from the tin roof.

""We dragged the mattress to that corner, it's the only dry place in the house,"" she said, adding she hoped the cold wouldn't make her sicker – she has throat cancer and relies on charity for medical care.

Nearby, Abu Hussein, 32, huddled under blankets in his tiny one-room home with his two children. ""This is how we keep warm,"" he laughed.

Elsewhere, Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip declared a state of emergency over the storm. An eight-month-old Palestinian infant in the Tulkarem refugee camp died in a fire caused by a heating stove, said Palestinian civil defence ministry spokesman Louay Bani Odeh.

Snow also accumulated in the Golan Heights and northern Israel. Jerusalem schools closed ahead of a forecast warning of 10 inches (25 centimetres) of snowfall. The weather dominated Israeli media newscasts as snow fell in repeated bursts in Jerusalem, with media promising more snowfall later.

Israeli police closed roads in the country's north as Jerusalem city officials directed snow preparations from a ""war room"" in a bunker underneath city hall, and deployed about 150 snowplows. The military readied armoured personnel carriers to help the police.

A downtown supermarket said it stored up on five times the amount of provisions, and employees were to spend the night at the store because of road closures.

In Egypt, a sandstorm engulfed Cairo for a second day, followed by a brief rainfall Wednesday while in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, gusty winds toppled a minaret. The state MENA news agency reported no casualties, adding that the mosque was subsequently shut down for repair work.

In Syria, snow blanketed Qassioun Mountain, which overlooks the capital, Damascus. The snowfall also brought traffic to a near standstill in the city and the Education Ministry shuttered schools and universities for two days.

Heavy fog also blanketed parts of Pakistan on Wednesday morning. Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said officials temporarily closed Islamabad's Benazir Bhutto International Airport due to bad weather, diverting incoming flights to Lahore.

In Amman, Royal Jordanian cancelled some of its Thursday and Friday flights due to bad weather, including those to Iraq, Tel Aviv, Dubai, Riyadh and Cairo.

Some found joy amid the stormy weather. Abdul-Hamid Ayash, a 32-year-old trader stranded in Beirut after snows closed the route to his mountain home, smoked a cigarette by the sea, watching waves crash against concrete breakers.

""I'm not sorry I'm stuck here,"" he said. ""Is there anything nicer than walking in the rain?""

Diaa Hadid reported from Beirut. Associated Press writers contributing to this report include Mohammed Daraghmeh in Ramallah, West Bank; Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip; Daniel Estrin and Ian Deitch in Jerusalem; Ryan Lucas in Beirut; Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria; Merrit Kennedy in Cairo; Omar Akour in Amman, Jordan, and Rebecca Santana in Islamabad."

Villagers made the grim discovery in the Strandzha, a massif that straddles the Bulgarian-Turkish border, police in the regional capital of Burgas said. The men were aged 28 and 35.

The Strandzha is the only part of the 200-kilometre frontier that has not been closed off by barbed-wire fencing — a measure aimed at discouraging migrants from crossing into EU member Bulgaria.

On Monday, a Somali woman was found dead from the cold in the same region.

The influx of more than one million asylum seekers — mostly from war-torn Syria — into the European Union in 2015 triggered the worst refugee and migrant crisis on the continent since the Second World War.

But the number crossing to European shores on rickety boats plunged in 2016 by almost two-thirds to 364,000, EU border agency Frontex said Friday.

Frontex pointed to an EU border deal with Turkey, which came into effect in March, as having paved the way to a massive decline in the number arriving in Greece."

In the wake of at least one known shipwreck of an over-crowded and flimsy vessel off the coast of Libya, at least eight bodies were recovered by European authorities. According to the Italian Coast Guard, a French ship operating under the Frontex operation sighted and rescued four people in high seas on Saturday 30–40 miles (48–64 kilometres) from Libyan shores.

Early reports from survivors say at least 100 people were on board a dinghy that collapsed some 30–40 miles from the Libyan coast, between Tripoli and Misurata. Last night (14 January), the Italian Coastguard rescued another 34 people close to oil platforms some 55 miles (88 kilometres) from the Libyan coast.

Italian authorities also report that three survivors from another rescue operation have since died from hypothermia, while another two had died on board a dinghy from suffocation.

Survivors and victims from rescue efforts in recent days have already been disembarked on Saturday in Lampedusa and on Sunday in the port city of Messina, on the north east coast of Sicily. UNHCR staff assisted during the operations and during the mourning of the victims.

“In what is already a tragic start to 2017 on the Mediterranean Sea, I am really heartened to see the first priority of saving lives in action through the rescue efforts of the Italian Coastguard and Frontex who have braved such extreme weather to rescue so many people,” said Vincent Cochetel.

“The survivors – whether refugees or migrants – have gone through unimaginable physical and psychological suffering,” said Cochetel, adding that UNHCR will work closely with authorities to refer them to health services.

Last year was the deadliest year on record on the Mediterranean Sea with more than 5,000 deaths recorded. This compares to the 3,771 recorded in 2015.

This deadly start to 2017 highlights the urgent need for States to increase pathways for admission of refugees, such as resettlement, private sponsorship and family reunification, so they do not have to resort to dangerous journeys and the use of people smugglers.

The 20-year-old, killed on a motorway leading to the port on Saturday, was the first migrant known to have died in an apparent attempt to board a UK-bound vehicle in the area since Europe’s largest migrants’ camp was razed in October.

As many as 50 migrants are estimated to be arriving in Calais each day, Frédéric Baland, a police union spokesman, said. About 400 are now in the area, according to aid workers and local sources.

“Dismantling the camp has not stopped the flow of migrants in Calais,” Mr Baland said. “We’ve gone back to the same situation we had here three or four years ago, with small groups scattered in the town. We estimate the number of daily arrivals at between 30 and 50.”"

“Crossing the river illegally is a hazardous and potentially life-threatening act,” stated Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak. “The current river height makes it especially dangerous as evidenced by the multiple rescues and incidents that have occurred. I encourage everyone to spread the word of the dangers and inherent risk.”

On Jan. 31, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Eagle Pass marine agents on daily patrol located a deceased person on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande River. With the help of the Eagle Pass Fire Department, agents and local officials were able to extract the deceased from the water.

Switzerland - IOM reports that 11,010 migrants and refugees entered Europe by sea in 2017 through 5 February – about 85 percent arriving in Italy and the rest in Greece. This compares with 74,808 during the first 36 days of 2016. IOM has registered 4,879 more arrivals since its last report (3/2), of whom 1,596 were rescued at sea during the weekend in 15 different operations.

IOM’s Missing Migrants Project reports an estimated 255 deaths at sea on various routes, compared with 380 during the first 37 days of 2016. The lone death recorded since IOM’s last report on Friday (3/2) was that of an Ethiopian woman recorded off Greece over the weekend. The latest figures do not include several deaths reported off Libya on Saturday (4/2). (See below.)

IOM Athens reports that 1,651 migrants or refugees have arrived by sea in Greece so far this year – less than 2.5 percent of arrivals in Greece by this time last year. On Friday (3/2), IOM reported the arrival of 142 migrants to the islands of Lesvos, Samos and Kalymnos. This was one of the few times this year that over a hundred arrivals have been recorded in a single day.

On Sunday, IOM Turkey reported that the Turkish Coast Guard, which recovered the remains of the Ethiopian woman, also rescued 45 people, including 21 Syrians, 18 Afghans, two Cameroon nationals, one Ethiopian, one Eritrean, one Bangladeshi and one Congolese national.

IOM Libya reported that on Friday and Saturday (03 and 04/02), four rescue-at-sea operations were conducted, resulting in the rescue of 592 migrants off western Libya.

On Friday, 300 migrants (265 men, 30 women and five children—including one new-born) were rescued off Az Zawiyah. The survivors were from Sierra Leone, Gambia and Nigeria.

On Saturday, 113 migrants were rescued off Tripoli, including 98 men, 10 women and five children from several African countries. The migrants came from Ghana (22 men), Nigeria (18 men, 7 women, at least one of them pregnant), Senegal (19 men), Cote d’Ivoire (14 men), Sierra Leone (nine men, one woman), Benin (one family of three men, one woman and four children), the Gambia (nine men), Liberia (two men), Niger (one man), Burkina Faso (one man) and Mali (one new born child and one woman). The migrants were taken to the Triq Al Shook detention centre.

Also on Saturday, 118 migrants – 37 women, of whom one was pregnant, three children (one-month, two years and three years) and 78 men from Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Cote d’Ivoire were rescued off Zuwara. IOM is coordinating medical assistance with the Libyan Red Crescent and an NGO medical partner – STACO.

Also on Saturday, 61 migrants were rescued off Az Zawiyah. The rescued included 26 men from Bangladesh, 26 men of different African nationalities (most from the Gambia), seven women from different African countries, two of whom are pregnant, and two children. One of the pregnant women was taken to Az Zawiyah Central Hospital.

Witnesses said their rubber boat started its journey to Italy in Subratah, but apparently left without a compass, GPS or satellite phone. After about six hours, the boat started to take on water and began to sink. Survivors say they spotted a helicopter. But despite people waving and screaming for help, it disappeared. People then started falling into the water.

“I saw three children, aged 3-5 years old, sinking and I wasn't able to rescue them because they sank and disappeared too fast,” explained a 30-year-old man from Nigeria. He said that only people wearing life vests survived. He did not know how many lost their lives at sea.

IOM has visited Triq Al Shook and is in the process of distributing non-food items and hygiene kits, including blankets and clothes, and is coordinating with partners to assist with medical support. IOM’s protection team has also visited the detention centre and is in the process of conducting vulnerability tests to assess the needs of the most vulnerable migrants.

So far in 2017, 1,401 migrants have been rescued off the Libyan coast and 42 bodies have been retrieved in Subratah, Zuwara, Tripoli and Tajoura.

Strong winds and a faulty engine led to the sinking of the boat, which was spotted by patrolling Turkish Coast Guard boats some two miles off the coast. Diverse group of migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Bangladesh and Cameroon were brought to the port by Turkish officers and they were supplied with new clothes, food and temporary shelter.Turkey saw a drop in the number of refugees using its territory to cross into Europe. The number of refugees crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece fell by 86 percent month-on-month in January, the Turkish Coast Guard recently announced.The data seems to reflect the success of the EU-Turkey deal that came into effect last March to put an end to illegal migration and clamp down on human trafficking.According to the Coast Guard command, 756 people were intercepted in January, compared to 5,506 people in the same month last year. Last month's figure is the second lowest number of people intercepted in the Aegean in two years.In January 2016, 103 people drowned attempting to reach Greece, while last month there were no recorded fatalities.Tens of thousands have attempted the short but dangerous journey across the Aegean before heading to northern and western Europe. The International Organization for Migration has estimated there were more than 363,000 arrivals in Europe by sea last year.Under a deal with the EU, Turkey stepped up efforts to prevent illicit migrants reaching EU member Greece and agreed to take back those who land in Greece in return for the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Europe.Bad weather conditions and unsafe boats make the journey extremely dangerous. Still, tempted by supposed advantages and ignoring rising xenophobia in Europe, migrants take the perilous journey. Most say they prefer risking their lives instead of remaining in war-torn, poverty-stricken countries."

The overall number of refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants counted in Serbia stood around 7,700. Over 6,600 (86%) of them were sheltered in 17 heated government facilities (below chart refers). The rest were staying rough in Belgrade city centre or the North.

A second tragic death by hypothermia of a refugee/migrant during this winter was confirmed. Both victims had been abandoned by smugglers in the hills/woods near the Serbian-Bulgarian border. After a woman from Iraq died close to the border with Bulgaria in mid-December, authorities now retrieved the body of a man from Pakistan near Pirot, who had gone missing at the end of January. The authorities assisted with the transfer of his remains to relatives in Western Europe.

Efforts to resolve the situation of refugee/migrant men and boys squatting in Belgrade city centre progressed.

UNHCR continued supporting the rapid refurbishment of capacities in the Obrenovac centre. Small groups of men and boys used governmental transport from the city centre, while some also went to Obrenovac spontaneously, requesting accommodation. Now Obrenovac accommodates 765 refugee/migrant men, including 345 boys. Accordingly, fewer men and boys appear to be sleeping rough in Belgrade city centre. At the same time, UNHCR and partners transported 36 newly registered asylum seekers from Belgrade city centre to asylum centres.

Hungarian authorities admitted 19 asylum seekers into procedures at the Hungarian “transit zones” near Kelebija and Horgos border crossings. During the same period, over 70 asylum-seekers informed UNHCR and partners to have been denied access to asylum procedures in Hungary but instead been collectively expelled back into Serbia, with some alleging maltreatment by Hungarian police. As per its global protection mandate,

UNHCR also continues following up on reports of unlawful expulsion of asylum-seekers from Serbia to Bulgaria and FYR Macedonia."

- Le associazioni benefiche libiche presenti a Bani Walid, 150 chilometri a sud-est di Tripoli, hanno sepolto ieri le salme di 12 migranti africani la cui identità non è nota. I loro corpi si trovavano da giorni nelle celle frigorifero dell’ospedale locale. Non è stato possibile identificare questi migranti e per questo sono stati sepolti in una fossa comune della città. Finora sono un centinaio i migranti africani la cui identità non è stata riconosciuta sepolti a Bani Walid da alcuni mesi. Si tratta di persone trovate morte nella zona che avevano perso ogni speranza di proseguire il loro viaggio di migrazione verso l’Europa.Secondo gli ultimi dati dell’Organizzazione mondiale per i migranti (Oim), un totale di 13.924 migranti e rifugiati sono entrati in Europa via mare nel 2017 fino al 22 febbraio scorso: oltre 10.000 sono giunti in Italia, altri 2.200 in Grecia e altri 1.000 in Spagna. Ciò a fronte di 105.427 arrivi durante le prime otto settimane del 2016, il 90 per cento dei quali era arrivato in Grecia. I numeri mostrano un significativo aumento degli arrivi in Italia rispetto allo stesso periodo dello scorso anno: 10.701 rispetto agli 8.102. Il traffico verso la Grecia si è invece quasi fermato dopo l’accordo tra Unione europea e Turchia. L’Oim riporta inoltre 366 morti in mare sulle varie rotte mediterranee, a fronte di 425 decessi dell'anno scorso, queste ultime quasi tutte lungo la rotta orientale. Il percorso del Mediterraneo centrale tra la Libia per l'Italia ha registrato 326 decessi fino al 22 febbraio, più del doppio rispetto alle 97 morti dello stesso periodo dello scorso anno. La Mezzaluna rossa ha annunciato mercoledì 22 febbraio la morte di 14 migranti asfissiati in un container vicino Khoms, 150 chilometri a ovest di Tripoli. Poche ore prima sempre la Mezzaluna rossa libica aveva rinvenuto i corpi di 74 migranti sulle spiagge di al Zawiya, lungo la costa della Libia nord-occidentale. (Res)"

Italy has seen migrants arriving by boat at a record-setting pace so far this year, with far more people braving the crossing from North Africa this year than in the previous three years, Italian figures showed on Friday.

Another 500 migrants were heading to Sicily and expected to arrive in the next couple of days, after being picked up from flimsy boats off the coast of Libya.

Proactive Open Arms, which operated one of the rescue ships, also said on Twitter that five migrants had drowned before one of the rescues, but a Coast Guard spokesman could not confirm the deaths.

In Catania, on Sicily's east coast, the body of the 16-year-old boy was taken off the Siem Pilot, a Norwegian vessel operating on behalf of European Union border agency Frontex.

""Unfortunately one of the migrants ... died on the Siem Pilot on Friday morning as a result of an illness,"" the ship's commander, Jorgen Berg, told Reuters. The boy's illness was still unknown, but he had no visible wounds, Berg said. His nationality was not disclosed.

There had been 487 migrant deaths in the Mediterranean as of March 2, according to International Organization for Migration, higher than the 425 during the first two months of last year.

Boat migrant arrivals in Italy are up more than 57 percent on the same period last year, according to Italian Interior Ministry figures. About half a million have arrived in Italy since the start of 2014, with a record 181,000 arriving in 2016.

Those who have come so far this year have told of increasing violence and brutality in Libya, where rival factions battle for power and people smugglers operate with impunity amid the chaos left by the 2011 overthrow of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.

Humanitarian groups say an agreement signed last month between Italy, the EU and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli is one of the causes for the recent surge in migrant departures.

The agreement aims to stop more migrants for setting out for Europe in part by funding migrant camps in run by the U.N.-backed government.

Coastguard Mohamed al-Alay said the refugees, carrying official UN refugee agency (UNHCR) documents, were travelling from Yemen to Sudan when they were attacked by an Apache helicopter near the Bab el-Mandeb strait.

A senior official with the UN’s migration agency confirmed later that 42 bodies had been recovered after the military attack on a boat carrying refugees off the Yemeni coast.

Mohammed Abdiker, emergencies director at the International Organization for Migration [IOM] in Geneva, said, however, that various survivors provided conflicting messages about whether the attack came from a military vessel or an attack helicopter that had taken off from the vessel.

Abdiker called the attack, which happened at about 3am, was “totally unacceptable” and that responsible combatants should have checked who was aboard the boat “before firing on it.”

One of the survivors, a Yemeni people trafficker, told the Associated Press his vessel had been hit by fire from a helicopter gunship. Al-Hassan Ghaleb Mohammed said the boat had been about 30 miles off the shore of Yemen when it was attacked.

He added that when the gunship opened fire, panic erupted among the refugees. They finally managed to hold up flashlights and show the helicopter they were migrants. He said the helicopter then stopped firing but only after more than 40 Somalis had been killed.

Despite the depiction of the incident, however, an IOM spokesman in Geneva said he was unable to confirm news reports indicating that an Apache had been responsible for the attack, but added: “Our confirmation is that there are dozens of deaths and many dozens of survivors brought to hospitals.”

The rebel-controlled Saba agency said the refugees had been attacked from the air by the Saudi-led coalition battling the insurgents, but did not provide further details.

Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition in the war in Yemen, has US-built Apache A-64 Longbow attack helicopters.



Maj Gen Ahmed Assiri, spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, dismissed the accusation saying that the force had not been involved in fighting in Hodeida.



“There has been no firing by the coalition in this zone,” he said. The kingdom’s Al-Madinah class frigates, one of which was damaged in an attack by a Houthi militia in January, are also capable of carrying a single helicopter. Other naval forces operating in the area are also equipped with helicopters, including the US military.

Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump, denied US involvement, saying no US strikes had been conducted in Yemen in the past 24 hours.

Despite the witness account, details of the incident remained confusing. A port official gave a contradictory account of the incident, telling Agence France-Presse the boat had docked at the port and the dead and injured had been hit with light weapons fire.



Images from the aftermath showed Yemeni officials in Hudaydah examining some of the recovered bodies at the city’s port including men, women and children. Al-Hassan Ghaleb Mohammed told AP the Somalis on board had been trying to escape from war-torn Yemen and cross the Red Sea to get to Sudan in Africa.

Commenting on the incident, the UNHCR condemned “this tragic incident, the latest in which civilians continue to disproportionately bear the brunt of conflict in Yemen”.

A UNHCR spokeswoman in Yemen, Shabia Mantoo, told Reuters: “We are distressed by this incident and understand that refugees were travelling in a vessel off the coast of Hudaydah which was reportedly impacted during the course of hostilities.”

Mantoo said refugees and asylum seekers had been moving out of Yemen and heading north because of deteriorating conditions.

The incident occurred amid concerns that the Saudi-led coalition was preparing to launch a wider operation against the port city.



A local news agency also reported a sharp rise in the Saudi-led coalition’s air raids on Thursday around the port.

Naval vessels were targeted in the strait last autumn. In October, two service personnel were killed when a United Arab Emirates vessel was hit. Later that month, the USS Nitze and USS Mason came under anti-ship missile fire.



US retaliatory fire destroyed several Houthi-controlled radar sites in and around the port of Hudaydah – the same immediate area where the refugee boat was struck – with cruise missiles. Hudaydah is controlled by Iran-allied Houthi fighters who in 2014 overran Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, and forced the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee into exile.

While the Houthis are less well-equipped than the Saudi coalition, one of their most sophisticated weapons has been its missile systems.

A Saudi-led coalition was formed in 2015 to fight the Houthis and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh who have fired missiles into neighbouring Saudi Arabia.

The Bab el-Mandeb is a strategic waterway at the foot of the Red Sea through which nearly 4m barrels of oil are shipped daily to Europe, the US and Asia."

Libyan coastguard intercepts humanitarian rescue ship Golfo Azzurro

The Libyan coastguard intercepted a humanitarian rescue ship the Mediterranean on Tuesday, threatening to open fire on the crew if they did not sail to Tripoli. The boat, belonging to the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms was conducting a training exercise in international waters when staff noticed a the Libyan ship approaching them. On the ship’s radio, a member of the coastguard boat’s crew can be heard telling aid workers that there were being taken into custody and ordering them to sail towards Tripoli. The man then threatens the group, saying if they don’t follow the orders, they will be “targeted”. “This is Libyan sovereignty,” he can be heard saying. “You have to sail now towards Tripoli port. You are under custody, sir.’‘ ‘‘If you don’t follow the orders we will target you. I have already warned you before. Libya’s government has warned you before but you don’t listen. It is your problem.,” he continues. Spokesperson for Proactiva Open Arms Laura Lanuza told Euronews: “Our boat, the Golfo Azurro, was doing some rescue training 27 miles away off Libyan coast on Tuesday, in International waters. Suddenly the crew saw a Libyan Coast Guard patrol approaching them at full speed. Then, the threats started coming through the radio. http://www.euronews.com/2017/08/16/migrant-rescue-boat-threatened-by-libyan-coastguard-in-international-waters

Rescue ship docked in Pozzallo

Italy on Aug 9 gave permission to the ""Golfo Azzurro"" to dock and disembark migrants in Sicily after three days of arguments with Malta over who should take in the rescued men. Maltese officials told the ""Golfo Azzurro"", which had been on its way to Malta for a crew change when it carried out the rescue, to go to the Italian island of Lampedusa, where Italian authorities refused it access. She then stayed in international waters off Sicily until Aug 9, when it had a mechanical problem and Italy's Coastguard gave the ship permission to enter the port of Pozzallo. The three rescued Libyans disembarked in Pozzallo. The men told the Golfo Azzurro crew they were persecuted and feared for their lives in Libya, Gatti said, and all planned on asking for asylum.

Rescue ship still stranded off Italy

The ""Golfo Azzurro"", operated by Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, was still right outside Italian territorial waters. The ship rescued three migrants from a little boat about 100 miles off the Libyan coast 72 hours ago. Since then, the ship has been sailing between the territorial waters of Malta and Italy on a parallel route with Malta's waters, then it travelled towards Italy and then, since the afternoon of Aug 8 it has been sailing close to Italian waters. old The Malta Independent that the boat is just outside Sicily, waiting for instructions by the Italian authorities. In the evening, the vessel started to head North towards Pozzallo after a diplomatic dispute between the Maltese and Italian authorities. The ship has been stranded outside Malta's waters as Italian authorities refused to let the migrants disembark. The Maltese authorities did the same with Deputy Prime Minister Chris Fearne saying that Malta has every right to refuse the migrants. The boat was originally headed towards Lampedusa. It was diverted to Malta after the Italians believed that the NGO involved in the rescue operation, failed to comply with the most recent code of conduct. The Maltese government also refused to let the ship enter Maltese waters arguing that international maritime law clearly states that the ship had to disembark in the nearest port of call, which in this case means Lampedusa. The vessel was originally believed to be operated by the Dutch NGO Boat Refugee Foundation. However it later emerged that the vessel had recently shifted ownership to Proactiva Open Arms."

One woman was found dead while more than 1,000 refugees were rescued off the Libyan coast, aid groups said on Sunday.

Around 400 people were crammed onto a single wooden boat, while others were picked up from huge inflatable dinghies, which had set sail from the coast of Libya, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and SOS Mediterranee.

A young woman was found unconscious on one of the vessels and later died, MSF said.

Two rescue ships found the refugees, just days after 250 migrants and refugees from African countries were reported missing in boat disasters off the Libyan coast.

The weekend rescues mean that about 22,000 mainly African refugees have been picked up heading to Italy so far this year, while around 520 have died trying to make the crossing.

An Italian prosecutor said last week that humanitarian ships operating off Libya were undermining the fight against people smugglers and opening a corridor that is ultimately leading to more deaths.

Non-governmental organisations deny any wrongdoing, saying they are simply looking to save lives.

Despite rough winter seas, refugee departures from Libya on boats chartered by people traffickers have accelerated in recent months from already record levels.

More people died in the Mediterranean over the first nine weeks of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says. From January 1 to March 9 this year, at least 521 people drowned while attempting to cross the rough waters compared to 471 in the same period a year ago.

There were about 5,000 recorded deaths in all of 2016.

Last month, European leaders signed a controversial plan to help stem the flow of African migrants to Europe. As part of the deal, the European Union will give $215m to Libya’s fragile government to step up efforts to stop boats in the country’s territorial waters.

The EU will also provide support for the setting up of “safe” camps in Libya and the voluntary repatriation of refugees willing to return to their countries of origin.

The plan has been criticised by several aid groups, however, that say leaders have abandoned humanitarian values and misrepresented conditions in Libya, where the UN-backed government of Fayez Serraj has only shaky and partial hold on the country."

“The BGB (Border Guard Bangladesh) later found the boat anchored at a river island. One woman was found shot dead and four were injured,” Mainuddin Khan, the police chief in the Bangladeshi border town of Teknaf, told AFP.

Police also discovered 28,000 “yaba” – or methamphetamine tablets – aboard the boat, Khan said.

The dead woman and at least three of the injured men were Rohingya, he added.

But the head of Teknaf’s government-run hospital, Iskandar Mirza, said the woman identified as 50-year-old Jahida Khatun and the four injured were all Rohingya.

“Her bullet-ridden body was brought to the hospital, while four injured Rohingya men were brought in,” he told AFP.

Some 75,000 Rohingya refugees have entered Bangladesh since October, when government forces in Myanmar unleashed a bloody crackdown on the Muslim minority.

Many recalled horrific stories of villages being torched, relatives burned alive and the gang rape of women by security forces.

Mos headed to Cox’s Bazar, where overcrowded displacement camps have been housing Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution for decades.

The sudden influx in recent months prompted Bangladesh to resurrect a controversial plan to relocate refugees to an undeveloped island in the Bay of Bengal.

The UN rights council has agreed to investigate allegations of rape, murder and torture against the army, though Myanmar has denied its troops have been waging a campaign of ethnic cleansing.

A refugee has been electrocuted while attempting to climb on the roof of a Eurostar train heading for the UK.

The unidentified man was killed at Paris’s Gare du Nord, the busiest railway station in Europe, after being hit by a bolt of electricity from overhead power lines.

Investigators said he was caught on CCTV climbing safety fences to reach international lines at around 5am local time (4am BST) on Tuesday, but was killed “within seconds” on the roof of a parked train bound for London.

A source told Le Parisien identification would be “tough”, as the “victim’s burns made them unrecognisable”.

Power to railway lines had to be cut while emergency services recovered the man’s body, causing disruption to Eurostar and national services in France.

“There was an incident this morning at the Gare du Nord that affected some of our services,” a spokesperson for Eurostar said.

“They are now getting back to normal.”

It is the second time an asylum seeker has been electrocuted at the Gare du Nord, after an Egyptian teenager attempting to reach Britain died in July 2015.

An unknown number of migrants have also been suffocated, run over, hit by trains and drowned in desperate attempts to swim to England.

Disruption and deaths in the summer of 2015 caused Eurostar to deploy drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras to monitor the Channel Tunnel, while the British Government funded a multi-million pound wall separating Calais’s main motorway from refugee camps.

The “Jungle” was cleared by police last year, with the French government vowing to resettle evicted asylum seekers, but many have returned to the northern coast.

Thousands more are spread throughout the country after crossing to Europe by sea, including many sleeping rough in Paris, where police have been accused of violent crackdowns on homeless migrants.

The British Government has largely refused to resettle refugees who have already reached Europe, and dropped a commitment to house vulnerable children before freeing up 130 places following an “administrative error”.

Despite efforts to slow the flow of boats arriving from Turkey to Greek islands, the number of migrants crossing the Central Mediterranean to Italy is increasing.

A record of almost 1,100 men, women and children have died attempting sea journeys to Europe so far this year, while 44,000 have arrived mainly from Syria, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Iraq."

Around 2,900 people were rescued on Thursday, 2,300 of whom were found in international waters and taken to Italy , while 580 picked up in Libyan waters were returned to the north African country.

Through Friday until Saturday morning, coastguards rescued another 2,100 migrants packed in 17 vessels, but found the body of one man who drowned, the Italian coastguard said.

The number of migrants arriving in Italy has soared this year by more than 30 percent in comparison with the same period last year, with 46,000 people arriving so far.

But of every 39 migrants who survive the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, one dies, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said, adding that 1,244 migrants were known to have died so far this year.

The 'almost unrecognisable body' of the unidentified 30-year-old man was found hidden in a rooftop electrical unit of a train at Cannes La Bocca station just after 10pm last night.

Three other men ran away after a technician with SNCF, France's national railway, heard noises in the compartment and opened it.

The man's body was found close to Cannes La Bocca station shortly after 10pm last night

Many of the migrants who arrive in Italy are Africans who have paid thousands to people smugglers after being promised a new life in Europe

'All were migrants who had boarded at Ventimiglia in Italy,' said a source close to the case. 'The victim had been electrocuted while trying to remain hidden. Cause of death was cardiac arrest.

'It is common for migrants to board trains at Ventimiglia as they try to make their way to northern France, and then on to Britain.'

Many of the migrants who arrive in Italy are Africans who have paid thousands to people smugglers after being promised a new life in Europe.

They get across the Mediterranean in often hugely dangerous boats, and then continue their journeys alone.

The evening before the latest tragedy, British star Vanessa Redgrave was on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival after launching her documentary about immigrants called 'Sea Sorrow'.

It focuses on refugee camps in northern France, many of which are full of desperate young men prepared to take enormous risks to get to England.

The tragedy happened close to the site of the Cannes Film Festival, just hours after a documentary by Vanessa Redgrave (centre) about the refugee crisis was screened

Last Sunday another migrant was found with severely burnt legs in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, close to France's border with Italy, after climbing on a train roof at Ventimiglia.

In all there have been 12 migrant deaths in the area since 2016, with human rights group saying they have increased as border controls tighten.

Beyond being electrocuted on trains, migrants have also been killed on busy roads after trying to get aboard lorries.

Ms Redgrave, the Oscar winning 80-year-old actor turned director, said she wanted Sea Sorrow to highlight the 'horrifying deaths of so many people who shouldn't have ever had to get into these dreadful boats to try and get to safety.'

In an interview in Cannes this week, Ms Redgrave said: 'I hold our European government-and my own government-to blame.'

Other films focusing on migrants from war-torn countries at a highly political Cannes this year include 'Jupiter's Moon', by the Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo.

It includes a scene in which a Syrian refugee is shot repeatedly by a policeman dealing with new arrivals."

Ogni viaggio fruttava all'organizzazione una somma oscillante tra i 30 e i 40 mila euro e permetteva di introdurre sigarette di contrabbando destinate a essere rivendute nel territorio siciliano.

Kittson County Sheriff's department received a call last Thursday about a missing woman who was last believed to be in the county on Monday.

Members of the sheriff's office, with assistance from the U.S. Border Patrol, found the body of a woman near Noyes, Minn., on Friday around 3 p.m. CT. She was found in a ditch not far from the Canadian border, west of Highway 75, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

A preliminary autopsy report said 57-year-old Mavis Otuteye, who police believe is a citizen of Ghana, died from hypothermia.

Police said they are still waiting on a final autopsy.

Police added their investigation shows the woman was attempting to enter Canada when she died.

Kittson County Sheriff's Office and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are investigating the death.

In an email to CBC, RCMP said they are aware that remains were located near the border. RCMP said the Integrated Border Enforcement Team works closely with partners in the U.S., and they will assist the investigation if need be.

The fields around the Emerson, Man., border have become a pathway for many asylum seekers hoping to make a refugee claim in Canada.

In the first four months of this year, the RCMP intercepted 477 asylum seekers in Manitoba, federal government figures state.

""It was just a matter of time before someone was going to succumb to their injuries or get hypothermia out in the field or in the side of a road."" said Emerson-Franklin Reeve Greg Janzen.

""We didn't think we would find somebody this time of year,"" he said. ""We thought maybe we would find somebody who had frozen to death, I guess, in the winter, but weren't expecting that this time of year.""

Janzen said all he has been told is that the body was not found very far from Emerson and its border into the U.S., and that the woman was not a local resident from Kittson County.

The death is a reminder to the community that the risks asylum seekers are taking has not gone away, Janzen added.

Weather remains cold

""These people are walking in the middle of the night, they don't know where they are going and if this person did pass away from hypothermia, they are still travelling and it isn't safe, it's not really warm yet,"" he said.

Residents continue to check the ditches and fields, especially during seeding, Janzen said. As the crops start to grow tall and harvest season comes around, he said concern will be high.

""It is in the backs of their minds that they have to be on the lookout for something like that,"" he said.

Janzen said it's time to close the ""loophole"" requiring asylum seekers to do irregular crossings.

Under the Safe Third Country agreement, Canada generally does not accept refugee claimants coming in from the U.S., but there are exceptions. Canada is also a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention, so those who irregularly cross into the country — meaning they enter somewhere other than a border crossing — can be given permission to make a claim here."

The boat was near a rescue vessel when it suddenly listed and many migrants tumbled into the Mediterranean, Italian Coast Guard commander Cosimo Nicastro told Reuters. ""At least 20 dead bodies were spotted in the water,"" he said.

The rescue group MOAS, which also had a ship nearby, said it had already recovered more than 30 bodies. ""Most are toddlers,"" the group's co-founder Chris Catrambone said on Twitter.

The coast guard called in more ships to help with the rescue, saying about 1,700 people were packed into about 15 vessels in the area.

The transfer from these overloaded boats is risky because desperate migrants in them sometimes surge to the side nearest a rescue vessel and destabilise their flimsy craft, which then list dangerously or capsize.

More than 1,300 people have died this year on the world's most dangerous crossing for migrants fleeing poverty and war across Africa and the Middle East.

Last Friday, more than 150 disappeared at sea, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said , citing migrant testimony collected after they disembarked in Italy.

In the past week, more than 7,000 migrants have been plucked from unsafe boats in international waters off the western coast of Libya, where people smugglers operate with impunity.

Despite efforts by Italy and the European Union to bolster the Tripoli-based coast guard and funnel training and equipment to fight trafficking to the UN-backed government, record numbers of migrants are coming this year."

Er stirbt noch an der Unfallstelle.

Großkarolinenfeld - Wie die Polizei Rosenheim mitteilte, wurde am Mittwochvormittag bei Großkarolinenfeld (Lkr. Rosenheim) ein toter Flüchtling auf den Gleisen gefunden. Die Kripo geht von einem tragischen Unfall aus. Der Mann war offensichtlich auf dem Güterzug von Italien nach München unterwegs, als er auf Höhe Tattenhausen herunter fiel, vom Zug erfasst wurde und sich die tödlichen Verletzungen zuzog.

Identität des Toten ungeklärt

Bei dem Toten handelt es sich um einen Schwarzafrikaner. Die Polizei schätzt sein Alter auf etwa 18 bis 22 Jahre. Seine genaue Identität ist noch ungeklärt

In dem Güterzug, von dem der Geschädigte gefallen sein müsste, wurde ein herrenloser Koffer, allerdings ohne Ausweispapier, gefunden. Außerdem wurden am Güterzug Spuren gefunden, die auf das Überrollen durch den Zug hindeuten. Derzeit werden noch weitere Untersuchungen zum Unfallhergang am Institut für Rechtsmedizin in München durchgeführt.

Schon seit einiger Zeit bemerkt die Bundespolizei eine dramatische Zunahme an Flüchtlingen die mit Güterzügen einreisen wollen. Ein lebensgefährliches Unterfangen, wie sich nun tragischerweise herausgestellt hat. Denn oft befinden sich die Flüchtlinge dabei nicht in, sondern auf den Waggons.

TRIPOLI, June 10 (Reuters) - Libyan coastguards recovered the bodies of eight migrants from an inflatable boat found east of Tripoli on Saturday, with dozens of other migrants feared missing, a spokesman said.

""In general this type of boat carries 100 to 110 people, so we do not know what has happened to the others,"" said Issa al-Zaroog, a coastguard spokesman in the town of Garabulli.

It was not clear how the migrants, whose bodies were spotted by fishermen, had died, coastguard officials said.

Earlier, Tripoli coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem said one Bangladeshi migrant had been killed and two wounded in crossfire when coastguards from Zawiya, just west of Tripoli, had clashed on Friday with smugglers escorting migrant boats out to sea.

Qassem said two rubber boats and a wooden vessel carrying some 570 migrants had been intercepted near Sabratha, west of Tripoli, triggering the clashes, and that coastguards had destroyed a boat and a jet-ski used by smugglers, arresting three of them.

But afterwards a further five rubber migrant boats got away after smugglers had fired at the coastguard from the shore and from boats, Qassem said.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said separately that 380 migrants in three rubber boats had been intercepted off Zawiya and brought back to Libya on Friday, and that another 438 were intercepted on Saturday.

Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea, with the number making the crossing rising sharply since 2014.

So far this year more than 61,000 migrants have arrived in Italy after crossing the central Mediterranean, according to the IOM. Most are packed onto ill-equipped vessels by Libyan smugglers, and are rescued by European ships once they reach international waters.

Mediterranean,2017-06-10,8.0,52.0,60,79.0,,6.0,2.0,Unknown,Unknown,Drowning,Libya,Central Mediterranean,Unspecified location off the coast of Libya,http://bit.ly/2ssMSd2,4,"UNHCR is deeply concerned about the latest reports of deaths at sea on the Mediterranean this weekend.

According to the Italian Coast Guard, eight corpses have been recovered so far and at least 52 people are feared missing from two incidents involving large numbers of people on flimsy dinghies off the coast of Libya on Saturday.

More than 2,500 people have been rescued in over a dozen search-and-rescue efforts coordinated by the Italian Coast Guard on Saturday and Sunday. These people are expected to be disembarked in Italian ports over the coming days. It is also important that broader regional responsibility sharing responses for disembarkation are developed urgently. Solutions cannot just be in Italy.

UNHCR applauds the rescue efforts by European government authorities, the Italian Coast Guard and NGOs, but is deeply saddened that the death toll continues to rise. Over 1,770 people are estimated to have died or gone missing trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea so far in 2017, and it is only the start of the summer sailing season. More are believed to have died in the Sahara before arriving in Libya.

Saving lives must be the top priority for all, and further rescue efforts are needed along this still deadly route.

The mixed flows of people through East and West Africa towards Sudan, Niger and Libya continue unmanaged, and cruel smuggling networks flourish.

We urgently need renewed efforts to find different solutions for refugees and migrants in the countries they cross before they reach Libya, given the insecurity in that country and vulnerability of people on the move to horrific exploitation and abuse. In parallel, new measures on both sides of the Central Mediterranean Sea to seriously combat trafficking are needed.

UNHCR also urges that alternative and safe pathways be developed, so people do not undertake such dangerous journeys. For those in need of international protection, alternatives include family reunification, resettlement, refugee scholarships and private sponsorship.

Efforts must also be redoubled to address downstream the root causes behind these movements of people to Libya, including by solving conflicts and reducing poverty.

(AP) — Authorities say a man has been arrested and charged with transporting an immigrant in the country illegally who died in his pickup truck while traveling from the U.S.-Mexico border to Los Angeles.

Federal authorities say a man and his son saw Efren Jimenez dragging a woman's body in a remote stretch of Orange County Sunday and detained him, grabbed a cellphone from his pocket and called 911.

Homeland security agent Monica Abend wrote in court papers that Jimenez said he was hired to pick up two immigrants by a smuggling contact.

Abend says Jimenez told investigators the woman was limping when he met her and died during the trip.

U.S. attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek says 26-year-old Jimenez is not charged with her death.

Jimenez appeared in court but was not asked to enter a plea. The judge deemed him a flight risk and ordered him held without bail."

""This is among the world's most dangerous routes -- a journey that no one takes lightly,"" it said, as witnesses described the horror of watching friends and loved ones drown. After reports on Monday of a shipwreck off the Libya which claimed nearly 130 lives, the UNHCR said dozens of families with children were feared drowned in a separate incident after their boat snapped in two and sank off the North African country. ""According to witnesses, a boat carrying at least 85 people broke in two and sank shortly after setting off from Sabratha on Thursday,"" spokesman Federico Fossi told AFP. Three wooden boats had set sail together from the conflict-hit country that morning: those travelling on one of them were rescued at sea and brought to Italy, where they described the fate of the other two. One was intercepted by the Libyan coastguard and towed back to shore, while they saw the other snap in half, throwing many of those onboard into the sea, Fossi said. ""Some survived, later calling people they knew on the first boat to say they had been rescued by the Libyans. We don't know how many others were lost to the waves,"" he said. There were many families with children from Syria and North Africa among those feared dead. Migrants brought to Sicily on Monday told aid workers of yet another shipwreck in which seven people had died after falling overboard, including the husband of a pregnant survivor from Cameroon. ""These incidents are a reminder of the grave dangers that people confront when forced to flee their countries because of war and persecution,"" UNHCR's Cecile Pouilly said. ""Since the beginning of the year, over 77,000 people have tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe,"" said Pouilly, a spokeswoman. ""Despite the heroic work of those involved in rescue at sea, the death toll continues to rise. Close to 2,000 people are reported to have died or gone missing since the start of the year,"" she said. The UNHCR said it was appealing for ""enhanced"" rescue operations and safe alternatives for those in need of international protection so that people are not compelled to take such dangerous journeys. It also urged greater international efforts to address the root causes behind the movement of people to Libya -- conflicts and poverty -- as many of those arriving in the crisis-struck country find it difficult to leave again if not by sea."

During the early morning hours, officials from the Government of Mexico alerted Border Patrol Agents in Presidio about the discovery of two deceased subjects. Agents immediately responded to assist Mexican Officials. “Grupo Beta”, an office under the National Institute of Migration which is charged with providing humanitarian aid to immigrants, recovered the bodies from the river.

The victims are suspected of being part of a larger group of undocumented aliens who illegally crossed into the United States in the same vicinity and were arrested by Border Patrol Agents.

The Big Bend Sector International Liaison Unit is working closely with authorities at the Mexican Government to identify those deceased so that the next of kin can be notified.

The landscape of Big Bend Sector is rugged and desolate. Many undocumented aliens who are apprehended or rescued are unprepared for adverse weather or long distances they often must travel on foot. The Big Bend Sector maintains a Border Patrol Search, Trauma and Rescue (BORSTAR) unit designed to rescue those in distress. The sector also has Border Patrol Agent-EMTs at many of its stations who respond to medical emergencies. Through its International Liaison efforts with the Government of Mexico along with the “CBP Dangers Campaign”, the United States Border Patrol is active in communicating the dangers of crossing the border illegally to potential crossers. The Big Bend Sector continues to work with its federal, state and local law enforcement partners and the Government of Mexico to secure and promote safety along the 510 miles of the southwest border for which it represents.

If you see persons in distress or come upon illegal activity, you can report it by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT , Big Bend Sector Border Patrol 1-866-581-7549 or El Paso/New Mexico area Border Patrol 1-877-872-7435 ."

Europe,2017-07-01,1.0,,1,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Mixed or unknown,Italy,Italy to France,Italy - France border at Ventimiglia,http://bit.ly/2mDdKSz,1,"Andrea Quadroni & Michele Luppi

Only a few months have passed since the closure of the French border at Ventimiglia, but the decision has already caused 12 fatal accidents. Drowned, run over, fallen, and electrocuted, migrants keep dying in their attempts to cross the border or get lost and hurt themselves in dangerous places. This is the first of three reportages by Michele Luppi and Andrea Quadroni about border deaths and includes an interactive map of the places where they have been killed.

His name was Alfatehe-Ahmed Bachire, he was 17 years old, and he came from Sudan. He is the latest dead migrant at the French-Italian border, drowning at the mouth of the Roja river on June 13. Some witnesses report that he was simply attempting to retrieve a shoe in the water, an accident with a tragic outcome. According to Intersos, the NGO that provides healthcare and legal aid to those migrants outside the reception system in Ventimiglia, his death is not a simple fatality. Rather, it is a consequence of the utter degradation in which those who came here to cross the border have been living for months.

“Our government cannot close its eyes to this deeply unfair death,” Cesare Fermi of Intersos says, “because it is the result of the persistent and shameful degradation of the area around Ventimiglia. A critical situation that has been deliberately worsened by a policy based on militarisation, repression, and rejection. On the French side, the Border Police arbitrarily refouling minors, and roundups and deportations on the Italian one.”

This is not the first migrant death in the river running through Ventimiglia. On November 21, 2016, a man was swept away by the current; his body has never been found. A total of 11 migrants have died at the border between Italy and France since September 2016: eight of them were killed in their attempt to cross it, three died while they were still in Ventimiglia. Besides the two victims mentioned above, another migrant was hit by a scooter on January 4, 2017, near the Red Cross accommodation centre in Ventimiglia’s Parco Roja. The Italian driver lost his life in the accident as well.

According to the statements of the border police during the press conference on the eve of the G7 summit in Taormina, 17,048 refoulements were carried out in 2016 at the border crossings of Ponte San Ludovico, Ponte San Luigi, Olivetta San Michele and Fanghetto, at the Ventimiglia railway station, and at the A10 motorway gate.

“The French government decided to reintroduce border checks on June 11, 2015,” says Maurizio Marmo, director of the Caritas in Ventimiglia-Sanremo. “This is the third summer in a row and, compared to the same period last year, numbers have doubled.”

The Red Cross camp accommodates about 300 migrants, but far more live in the city. About one hundred women together with children under the age of 16 have found shelter in the Church of S. Antonio in the neighbourhood of Gianchette. Many other migrants, around 300 or 400, spent a number of weeks in an informal camp on the Roja riverbed until June 26. On that date, the municipality of Ventimiglia ordered the evacuation of the area and fear pushed a group of about 400 refugees to set out all together towards France. Most of them were caught by the French authorities in the following hours and readmitted to Italy. Over one hundred were taken by bus to the hotspot in Taranto.

According to Antonio Suetta, Bishop of Ventimiglia, “these kind of situations expose migrants to major risks, and over the last few months have even claimed some victims. My main concern is what will happen to foreign unaccompanied minors, a group that represents a large part of the refugees in Ventimiglia. They should receive proper accommodation.”

In addition to those who have lost their lives, dozens of migrants have been wounded, some of them as young as Yasir, a 20-year-old from Sudan. When we meet him along the Roja river, his foot is noticeably bandaged. “I hurt myself three days ago,” he says, “on one of the paths that lead to France. I had already crossed the border when the police saw me. I tried to run away but I slipped on a heap of stones and got injured. Then they caught me and took me back to the border.”

Border deaths

On March 21, the French newspaper Nice-Matin reported the finding of a dead migrant on the French side of the mountain. Two days before, a guest had been noticed missing at Parco Roja but searches on the Italian side had been unsuccessful. His body was retrieved along the Grimaldi track, at the border between Menton and Ventimiglia, one of the crossing points used by migrants. It is referred to as the “death pass” because of its roughness; in the past, it was secretly used by antifascists and smugglers to cross the border.

“The dead body was found after several days and we cannot rule out the possibility of other victims we don’t know about,” Maurizio Marmo says. “Unfortunately, the track has many forks, and if you don’t know the way, you could end up on the edge of a ravine.”

On September 6, 2016, a young African boy trying to evade the border police and whose name is still unknown fell off a viaduct on the A8 motorway outside Menton near the village of Sainte-Agnès. One month later, on October 9, the 17-year-old Eritrean girl Milet Tesfamariam was hit by a truck at the French border on the A10. She was walking with some of her relatives through the tunnel after the Ventimiglia gate, just before French territory. The driver declared that he saw the group of migrants crossing the road and tried to slam on the brakes, but was unable to avoid the girl.

Less than two weeks later, on October 21, the French newspapers reported that another young migrant was hit by a car headed for Italy on the A8 near Menton. “According to the police,” Le Parisien read, “the presence of several people on this stretch of the motorway that leads from Italy to France had already been reported at the beginning of the night. Some of them were found and taken to the border police.”

Dangerous trains

Although migrants are increasingly caught trying to cross the border on foot, over the last ten months, trains have continued to cause the greatest number of casualties. On December 23, in the town of Latte, near Ventimiglia, a local train bound for Nice ran over a group of migrants walking towards France along the Ventimiglia-Menton lines. A 25-year-old boy from Algeria ended up on the ballast and died instantly.

The Mediapart report reveals that, in accordance with the procedure of the French railway company Sncf, in cases of accidents involving other people, the engine driver has to stop, get off to inspect the tracks, and inform the block post. At that point, traffic must be interrupted until police and first-aiders intervene. Furthermore, it is a winding route, with unlit tunnels and very poor visibility. A train needs from 300 to 800 metres to stop completely. This is why many accidents happen in the dark: border crossings are more frequent early in the morning or at the end of the day.

Daniela Zitarosa, legal operator of Intersos, explains, “Friday is one of the most stressful days because it’s market day and many French come to Ventimiglia to go shopping. Migrants try to take advantage of the confusion to get on the trains.” Some of them hide under the seats, in the banker, or in more dangerous places: electrical rooms, gangways, tool cabinets. Others try to enter France by walking along the railway tracks. On February 5, a migrant was hit in the Dogana tunnel, the last one before the border, by a local French train headed for Italy. The victim was with other migrants. Twelve days later, at the Cannes-La Bocca railway station, the dead body of an African man was found on the roof of a train; he had been electrocuted and was stuck in the pantograph, the device that connects trains and trams to the overhead high-voltage wires. On May 20, at the same railway station, the Sncf cleaning personnel found the electrocuted body of a 30-year-old from Mali in the small electrical room of a local Ter train.

Following all these deaths, the French railway company drew up an informative flyer warning people of the risks, and have asked the associations operating in Ventimiglia to help distribute it. In this way, they hope to prevent further deadly accidents.

Nameless dead

The number of the dead is not the only shocking thing at the border of Italy and France. It is also very difficult to find information about the victims and the current location of their corpses. As Marmo explains: “Unfortunately, most of the migrants died in France and we don’t know whether or not they were buried and, if they were, how. From this point of view, it’s hard for us to have an overview of the situation.”

But there is one person in particular every one remembers with special fondness at the Church of S. Antonio – the positive symbol of the city’s reception of migrants. Milet Tesfamariam, the 17-year-old Eritrean girl hit by a truck on October 9, was one of the twenty thousand migrants the church has accommodated since its opening on May 31, 2016. “We celebrated her funeral on October 15, here in the same church where she slept the night before she died,” Father Rito Alvarez says. “Dozens of migrants attended, most of them Eritrean, but there were also a lot of Italian and French volunteers as well as normal citizens.” Among them was Milet’s cousin who lives in Rome and came here in order to identify the body. The parish even organised a collection to raise the five thousand euros for the body to be repatriated. “It seemed the least we could do to restore her dignity,” the priest says.

The funeral was also attended by Antonio Suetta, the Bishop of Ventimiglia, who gave a harsh homily (the second part of which is available here): “Milet is a victim of the unfair regime of her country from which she escaped. A country everyone knows, but no one cares about. Milet is a victim of our borders–as legal as they are unfair–when they’re closed in people’s faces and inexorably shut before their cries for help. Milet is the victim of a society which claims to be civilized, which parades principles like brotherhood, freedom, and equality, but where people are persecuted and killed in the name of those principles. A society that has proven unable to apply these principles impartially, where some are more of a brother, freer, and more equal than others. Our civilization should be ashamed of this injustice. Milet is a victim of the piles of files that lie for too long on the desks of those in charge, of the unfair procedures that fail to do justice to the poor asking for help.”

UPDATED: shortly after this article was published in its original Italian version, we received news of a twelfth death: a migrant whose nationality is still unknown who was run over and killed by a truck in Latte (as reported on the map).



*UPDATED: sadly, more deadly incidents are being reported in the area of Ventimiglia: on May 24, 2017 a man from Senegal was found dead, he too electrocuted in the electrical room of a French train that had left from Ventimiglia. On August 16, 2017, a 36-year old Iraqi migrant died hit by a train at the mouth of the tunnel in the Puglia zone in Ventimiglia.

At least 35 refugees, including seven children, were feared drowned after their inflatable boat sank on Saturday off the Libyan coast.

Eighty-five refugees, including 18 women, were rescued after clinging to the boat with the help of fishermen who alerted the Libyan coastguard, said Issa al-Zarrouk, a coastguard official in Garabulli, 60 kilometres east of Tripoli.

Navy spokesman Ayoub Kacem said the boat sank 11km northwest of Garabulli, and 10 fishing boats took part in the rescue.

They were among 100 refugees on board when their rubber boat developed a malfunction off eastern Tripoli, he added.

Qasim said the rescued refugees were from Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast.

The official did not disclose the nationalities of those who were missing.

Nigerian hairdresser Vivian Effoussa described watching, horrified, as fellow passengers fell into the sea.

“The boat we entered was leaking,” said Effoussa, who attempted the crossing to Europe after struggling to support two children back home.

“All of a sudden … the water was (coming) inside. Everybody started shouting,” she said, speaking in English.

“Gradually, gradually, we see ourselves inside the sea. Everybody, we’re falling inside, dragging each other. They even pulled my hair, dragging me.”

“Really, I didn’t think the sea was big like this,” Effousa said, adding that, had she known, she would not have come.

The incident is the latest in a series of tragedies involving migrants desperate to enter Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.

Libya is the main departure point for Europe-bound migrants. Many of them come from poor African countries.

Human traffickers have exploited years of chaos in Libya since the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed dictator Muammar Gaddafi to boost their lucrative but deadly trade.

Tens of thousands of migrants have resorted to paying smugglers to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to what they hope will be a better life in Europe.

Nearly 77,000 migrants have landed in Italy since January, up 15 percent on the same period in 2016.

Altogether, at least 2,247 people have died or are missing after trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe this year, the IOM says.

Meanwhile, the bodies of 20 Egyptian nationals were found by Libyan authorities in a remote area of the Tobruk desert.

The director of the Tobruk Medical Centre, Faraj al-Gali, said on Friday evening that the Tobruk Medical Centre morgue had initially refused to accept the bodies because they were decomposed and feared the transmission of germs.

Colonel Maraqa Mohammed, head of the investigation unit of the illegal immigration agency, said that the bodies of the Egyptians were found south of the 200 gate near Wadi Ali, inside the sand area. They were brought from the desert by a number of civilian cars because there were no available government SUVs.

The bodies were buried after being searched by the Red Crescent in Tobruk. A number of cards, passports and a few personal belongings were found. The cause of death has not yet been identified."

Show Caption Hide Caption The Wall: Deadly deserts With more eyes watching the border, migrants are forced to walk for days in their attempt to cross from Mexico into the United States. Some make it. Some die. A USA TODAY NETWORK video production.

SONOYTA, Mexico — The body of Carlos Martinez arrived in the back of a dark blue Lincoln Navigator with the name of the funeral home, Soto Funeraria, on the door.

Selene Ramirez rushed over to peer inside a rear passenger door, along with her mother, an aunt and an older sister, while two of her uncles stood by.

The last time Ramirez remembers seeing her older brother, he was alive; they were laughing in her bedroom reminiscing about their childhood before Martinez set out to illegally cross the border through the deadly Arizona desert in mid-June.

The sight of his skeletal remains heavily wrapped in blue plastic confirmed he was dead. Ramirez and the other women began to sob; their wails shattered the late-afternoon quiet of that September day.

The remains of nearly 3,000 immigrants who died after illegally crossing the border have been found since 2001 in southern Arizona, the deadliest corridor along the southwestern border. Nearly 1,000 have yet to be identified, while hundreds of missing migrants who are believed to have perished still haven't been found, and may never be.

In other border states, the deaths of hundreds of border crossers often go uncounted because local authorities don't track or report them. As a result, many families of border crossers are forced to live with the agonizing uncertainty of not knowing if their loved one is alive or dead.

For Ramirez and her family, that agony was over. The uncertainty could now turn to grief.

""I can't tell you I am relieved because I am not,"" Ramirez said after her brother's remains were identified through DNA tests. ""My brother is dead.""

But in a way, ""it is relieving to at least be able to take him home.""

The discovery

The USA TODAY NETWORK accompanied Ramirez, a U.S. Citizen born in Phoenix, in late June as she drove out into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to search for her missing brother.

Several migrants who illegally crossed the border with him told Ramirez during a phone call that her brother had fallen ill in the heat. They said he collapsed in a valley south of a tooth-shaped mountain formation known as La Muela, the Molar, deep in the wilderness of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument about 12 miles north of the border.

Brought to the U.S. illegally when he was 9 months old, Martinez grew up in Phoenix. Arizona was home, his sister said. On his left shoulder was a tattoo: “AZ” inside the outline of the state's borders.

He was trying to return to Phoenix after being deported in 2016 for the second time. He was first deported in 2010 following a felony conviction for illegally firing a gun inside city limits when he was 17.

Ramirez's search was documented in a story and video documentary produced as part of the USA TODAY NETWORK's ""The Wall"" project. The nine-month reporting effort examined the unknown stories and unintended consequences of President Donald Trump's promise to build a wall along the entire 2,000-mile-long border separating the U.S. and Mexico.

Ramirez didn't find her brother's body during the June search. But about three weeks later, in mid-July, migrants trekking through the same area discovered skeletal remains clad in camouflage pants and Fruit of the Loom underwear, the brand Martinez was wearing the day he crossed the border.

This is the story of what happened after Martinez's body was found.

Awaiting DNA results

The migrants carried the remains back across the border into Mexico and left the body by a bridge along Highway 2, which runs along the border.

After being recovered by Mexican police, the remains were taken to a morgue in Sonoyta, a border town across from Lukeville, Arizona.

Mexican officials told the family DNA results could take until 2018.

But Ramirez and her family were desperate for an answer and called daily, sometimes multiple times a day.

""We just kept pushing them and pushing them until we finally got the results back,"" Ramirez said. ""It was very, very stressful.""

In late September, Mexican authorities contacted Ramirez's mother in Mexico and informed her that DNA results had verified the remains belonged to Martinez.

That same day, Ramirez left her child-care job in Phoenix and traveled with her 13-year-old sister, Stephany, by shuttle to the border. From there, they took a bus to Cananea, Mexico, arriving after midnight to meet their mother and the rest of their family in the Sonoran mining town about 50 miles southwest of Bisbee, Arizona.

The next day, Ramirez and several members of her family drove to Sonoyta to retrieve the body from the funeral home.

Identifying the dead

Because Martinez's body was carried back to Mexico, it would not be counted in data kept by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. That agency conducts autopsies on the bodies of migrants recovered in Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties. where the vast majority of migrant deaths in southern Arizona occur.

Since 2001, the remains of nearly 2,900 migrants have been found in southern Arizona, according to the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants, which maps migrant deaths based on data provided by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, and the Maricopa Office of the Medical Examiner.

Through Dec. 6, 123 remains have been recovered in southern Arizona this year and turned over to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. Of those, 27 had been identified.

Data kept by the medical examiners shows many migrants die of heat exposure or hypothermia. In most cases, only skeletal remains are found, making it difficult to determine the exact cause of death. It's unknown how Martinez died, but it most likely was due to heat exposure.

'That's not my brother. That's just bones'

Ramirez and her family arrived in Sonoyta at 2:30 p.m.

They planned to pick up the body at a funeral home there, drive an hour and a half to a funeral home in Caborca to have the remains cremated, and then be back in Cananea by 10 or 11 p.m. with the ashes for a memorial service.

They had spent the morning cooking a large pot of menudo, tripe soup, to serve guests and family at the memorial service.

But that is not how the day turned out.

When the family arrived at the Soto Funeral Home in Sonoyta, the director told them the death certificate needed to be signed by the medical examiner, who was 60 miles away in Puerto Peñasco.

The family waited outside the funeral director's house while one of the investigators from the attorney general's office drove toward Puerto Peñasco. Someone was going to meet him halfway with the signed certificate. He should be back in an hour, the family was told.

While the investigator was gone, the funeral director arrived at the house, with the body in the back of her Lincoln Navigator. After looking at Martinez's remains, Ramirez and her family sat on the curb, smoking cigarettes, as day turned to night.

""A lot of people, they get to see their loved ones. They get to touch them. We don't get to see him. We don't get to touch him. We get to take him home in a box,"" Ramirez said as they waited. ""That's not my brother. That's just bones.""

Hours passed.

Finally, just before 10 p.m., the funeral director returned with the death certificate. By then the family had been waiting nearly eight hours. Even so, they were determined to return to Cananea that night. Besides, the funeral home in Caborca had promised to wait for them to do the cremation, no matter how late they arrived.

Ramirez sat in the back of her brother's black SUV as they followed the funeral director's vehicle carrying Martinez's body to Caborca, 95 miles away.

On the outskirts of town, the convoy passed a checkpoint. Dozens of heavily armed federal police officers stood by on the lookout for drug cartel smugglers. The flashing lights on their police vehicles lit up the night.

Ashes

Ramirez and her family arrived in Caborca just before midnight. At the funeral home, a worker let them in. All of the rooms were dark except the entrance.

Before the cremation started, Ramirez and her family asked to see the body. When Martinez was 5 or 6, he fell climbing a pole and shattered his elbow. The metal pins used to repair his arm would prove beyond a doubt that the body belonged to Martinez.

Ramirez followed the worker to a back room, along with her sister, Reyna Martinez, 30; her aunt, Diana Canizales, 29; and her two uncles, Ricardo, 36, and Francisco, 40. Her mother, Elvira Canizales, 46, waited alone in one of the rooms.

When Ramirez returned, she and her sister were sobbing. They had asked for the body to be unwrapped from the head down, unable to bear looking at their brother's face. Ramirez and her sister were horrified by what they saw.

""He has no hands. He has no arms. He has no feet,"" Ramirez told her mother.

Unable to find the metal pins, they would have to trust the DNA results as confirmation that it was Martinez.

The funeral home worker slid the remains into a long metal tube lined with white bricks. The worker turned on the burners.

After nearly two hours, a metallic pounding sound came from the back of the funeral home. The family wandered outside to investigate. Across a concrete courtyard, the funeral home worker could be seen crushing smoldering bones with a metal pole inside a metal box.

After the bones had cooled, the worker poured them into an electric grinder, which crushed them into a white ash that wafted into the night air. He sealed the ashes in a plastic bag, placed it inside a wooden box decorated with a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and screwed the box shut.

Descansa en Paz. Rest in peace

By the time Ramirez and her family arrived in Cananea at 5 the next morning, dawn was breaking, silhouetting distant mountains in a pinkish glow. It happened to be Ramirez's 22nd birthday.

Family and neighbors, who had waited all night, wandered out of a two-room mobile home to greet them. The home, which belongs to Ramirez's mother, is on the edge of Cananea, overlooking a shimmering sea of tailings, refuse from the copper mine.

Martinez had lived here before he set out to cross the border.

Ramirez carried the box with her brother's ashes up three wobbly steps into the mobile home and walked across the cracked linoleum floor to a back corner. There she placed the box on a shelf and made a small altar with candles, a rosary and a Catholic statue of Jesus.

That afternoon, Ramirez gathered with her extended family outside the trailer. From the dirt driveway, mountains on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border were visible, just 30 miles to the north.

Cradling the box in her arms, Ramirez led the group in a procession to a small Catholic church up the street.

Her aunt carried a framed photo of Martinez. In the photo, he is sitting on a porch, wearing a white T-shirt and a wry smile. ""Descansa en Paz"" — Rest in Peace — ""Carlos Martinez,"" said words printed in Spanish on the photo.

On the day the photo was taken, Carlos had given himself a buzz cut. He had asked his youngest sister, Stephany, to take a picture with her cellphone while he posed on the porch with a cigarette in his hand.

During the Mass, the priest blessed the box containing Carlos' ashes.

But the priest made no mention of how Carlos died. Nor the conditions in Mexico that push people to cross illegally through the desert in search of a better life in the United States.

After the funeral Mass, Selene and her sister, Reyna, carried the box containing their brother's ashes back to their mother's home. The top of the box was wet with tears as family and friends lined up to pay their respects.

The next week, Ramirez returned to Phoenix, leaving her brother's ashes at her mother's home.

Over Christmas, she plans to return to Cananea to bring the box with the ashes back to Phoenix to complete the journey that claimed her brother's life.

""I think it will keep him at peace if we bring his remains to where he wanted to be,"" she said. ""I don't want to leave him where he was so desperately trying to escape when he lost his life.""

Show Caption Hide Caption At least 3 killed by currents in Rio Grande river First responders on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border have recovered at least three bodies and rescued seven people who were swept away by currents in the Rio Grande. Wochit

Another body was recovered from the Rio Grande Thursday just as authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border stepped up their efforts to prevent more drownings after four people died trying to cross the dangerous waterways this week.

U.S. Border Patrol agents were conducting a “mirror patrol” with Mexican law enforcement officials around 10 a.m. Thursday when they found the body of a man believed to be in his 30s in the Rio Grande near Midway Drive, officials said.

Under the initiative to patrol the river known as Operation Lifeguard, Border Patrol agents drive along the U.S. side of the Rio Grande as Mexican officials drive parallel to them on the other side of the border.

“We were working with (Mexican) government officials on Operation Lifeguard, a bi-national event done to show support and to work with our Mexican counterparts, when they found a body in the Rio Grande on the U.S. side,” U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Oscar Cervantes said. “We then called in the (El Paso) fire department to help recover the body.”

No information on the man's identity or whether he was attempting to enter the U.S. illegally was available late Thursday.

More: 3 bodies recovered, 7 people rescued from river in two days

He is the fifth person who has died this week attempting to cross the Rio Grande, officials said.

The bodies of the other three other people were recovered from the river on Monday and Tuesday, and a woman who was rescued from the river later died after being transported to University Medical Center of El Paso. At least 10 people attempted to cross the Rio Grande in that 48-hour time period, officials said.

U.S. Border Patrol and El Paso Fire Department officials rescued six people, while Mexican officials rescued a 15-year-old Guatemalan boy from the river, earlier this week.

Juárez authorities on Wednesday prevented a group of five Guatemalans from crossing the river as they sought to enter the United States illegally in search of work, officials said.

Border Patrol officials said that they and Mexican officials conduct Operation Lifeguard at random times, but have increased the patrolng in recent days due to the surge of drownings in the river and nearby canals.

“We do Operation Lifeguard randomly throughout the year, especially during monsoon season, but in light of the recent deaths we have seen with people being killed attempting to cross the Rio Grande, we decided to conduct the operation today,” Cervantes said. “Unfortunately, as we conducted the operation, we found a body.”

Officials said that while the Rio Grande current may not appear to be flowing fast, the undercurrents can be traveling at speeds of more than 25 miles per hour.

“We want to inform the public that it is not worth risking your life,” Cervantes said. “The ones that end up suffering the most are their families. The danger is tremendous, especially since it is monsoon season and we have an unusual amount of rain since last year. The water is a lot deeper in the Rio Grande and the canals… It has an undertow of more than 20 miles per hour. Right now, the water is deeper and it will take you. It is danger and it is sad to see this.”

A vigil, march and Mass will be held Friday for the five people killed this week after being swept away by currents in the Rio Grande.

The Detained Migrant Solidarity Committee, an advocacy group composed of religious leaders, refugees and other migrant advocacy groups, will hold the march at 8:30 p.m. at the San Jacinto Plaze in Downtown El Paso, officials said.

The march will then go to the Paso del Norte International Bridge on Santa Fe Street where the vigil will be held, officials said. The vigil will begin at 9 p.m.

The Catholic Diocese of El Paso will also host a Memorial Mass for the drowning victims at 2 p.m. Friday at Sacred Heart Church, 602 S. Oregon, officials said.

On Monday evening, officials in Mexico notified the U.S. Border Patrol that they had received information from a woman who stated she was lost north of the border on Otay Mountain and her husband was very ill and suffering from dehydration.

Border Patrol agents, along with the Border Patrol Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) team and CBP Air and Marine Operations, launched a search for the missing couple. Agents located the woman, a 22-year-old Mexican national, about two miles north of the border at about 6:45 a.m. on Tuesday. At about 8 a.m., a Border Patrol K-9 team found the deceased body of the woman’s husband, a 35-year-old Mexican national, near the area where the woman was located.

After an investigation, agents linked the couple to a group of six Mexican nationals who were previously apprehended about five miles north of the border near Dulzura. Within the group, agents were able to identify the smuggler, who was charged for human smuggling.

“Due to this tragic result, the smuggler should face the highest consequences,” said Acting Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Boone Smith.

To prevent the illicit smuggling of humans, drugs, and other contraband, the U.S. Border Patrol maintains a high level of vigilance on corridors of egress away from our Nation’s borders. To report suspicious activity to the U.S. Border Patrol, contact San Diego Sector at (619) 498-9900."

Aden – Early this morning (09/08), a human smuggler, in charge of the boat, forced more than 120 Somali and Ethiopian migrants into the pitching sea as they approached the coast of Shabwa, a Yemeni Governorate along the Arabian Sea. The migrants had been hoping to reach countries in the Gulf via war-torn Yemen.

Shortly after the tragedy, staff from IOM, the UN Migration Agency, found the shallow graves of 29 migrants on a beach in Shabwa, during a routine patrol. The dead had been quickly buried by those who survived the smuggler’s deadly actions. IOM is working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure appropriate care for the deceased migrants’ remains.

IOM’s medical staff also provided urgent care to the 27 surviving migrants, both females and males, who had remained on the beach. IOM provided initial health checks and assistance, including food, water and other emergency relief. Some of the survivors (approximately 42 in addition to the 27 survivors IOM spoke to) had already left the beach before being assisted. Twenty-two migrants are reportedly still missing and unaccounted for. The approximate average age of the passengers on the boat was 16.

""The survivors told our colleagues on the beach that the smuggler pushed them to the sea, when he saw some ‘authority types’ near the coast,"" explained Laurent de Boeck, the IOM Yemen Chief of Mission. ""They also told us that the smuggler has already returned to Somalia to continue his business and pick up more migrants to bring to Yemen on the same route. This is shocking and inhumane. The suffering of migrants on this migration route is enormous. Too many young people pay smugglers with the false hope of a better future,"" continued de Boeck.

Since January 2017 to date, IOM estimates that around 55,000 migrants left the Horn of Africa to come to Yemen, most with the aim of trying to find better opportunities in the Gulf countries. More than 30,000 of those migrants are under the age of 18 from Somalia and Ethiopia, while a third are estimated to be female.

This journey is especially hazardous during the current windy season in the Indian Ocean. Smugglers are active in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, offering fake promises to vulnerable migrants. IOM and its partners operate across the region to support these migrants and provide lifesaving assistance to those who find themselves abused or stranded along the route.

Aden – 160 Ethiopian migrants were violently forced into the sea off Yemen’s coast this morning (10/08). This comes one day after the presumed death of 50 Ethiopian and Somali migrants during a similar incident. As with yesterday, this tragedy took place off the coast of Shabwa, a Yemeni Governorate along the Arabian Sea – although in a different location and closer to the shore.

Staff from IOM, the UN Migration Agency, found six bodies on the beach – two male and four female. An additional 13 Ethiopian migrants are still missing (unaccounted for). IOM provided emergency medical assistance to 57 migrants today. IOM also provided food, water and other emergency relief assistance to the surviving migrants. 84 migrants (in addition to the 57) left the beach before IOM arrived.

Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives on this life-threatening route towards the Gulf countries through Yemen, a country in crisis. The journey and the situation in Yemen is extremely dangerous for migrants. The psychological effect these experiences have on children can be enormous. This is why IOM has psychologists embedded in their patrolling teams on Yemen’s beaches. The deadly actions of the smugglers today bring the total number of presumed dead over the last two day close to 70. More information on yesterday’s incident can be found in our previous release: http://www.iom.int/news/50-somali-ethiopian-migrants-deliberately-drowned-smugglers-yemen-0. IOM is aware of 114 dead or missing in 2017 off the coast of Yemen (Gulf of Aden and in the Red Sea en route to Yemen) and 109 in 2016. The actual total is likely to be higher.

Survivors from both incidents described their journey with the smugglers to IOM: Throughout the journey, migrants had been brutally treated by the smugglers. They were forced to squat down for the entirety of the trip from Ambah Shore in Somalia, which sometimes takes between 24-36 hours, so that the smugglers could increase the number of people in the boat. The migrants were not allowed to move inside the boat. They were not allowed a private or separate space to use the bathroom and had to urinate on themselves. In some cases, the smugglers tied their hands so if something did happen, they would not be able to run or swim or save their lives. If one of the migrants accidentally moved, he would be beaten or even killed. The migrants were not allowed to take enough food or water on the journey to fulfill their basic needs. They were only allowed to take one to two litres of water and one small meal. They also faced many dangerous during the journey in the windy season.

Migrant survivors from other smuggling journeys have told IOM that usually smuggler networks coordinate when migrants arrive in Yemen so that they would have a pick up location. Some migrants who are able to pay extra money are taken by car to unknown destinations. Others, who do not have money, walk for long distances, without knowing where they are headed.

“Recently, smugglers have been pushing migrants out of the boats, fearing that the security forces might arrest them. This is what happened the past two days in Shabwa,” said Lina Koussa, IOM’s Emergency Response Officer in Aden.

“We condemn the acts of smugglers off the coast of Yemen – 120 Somali and Ethiopian migrants were forced from a boat yesterday, and another 160 today, the death toll is still unknown,” said William Lacy Swing, IOM Director General.

“The utter disregard for human life by these smugglers, and all human smugglers worldwide, is nothing less than immoral. What is a teenager’s life worth? On this route to the Gulf countries, it can be as little as 100 USD. There is something fundamentally wrong with this world if countless numbers of children can be deliberately and ruthlessly drowned in the ocean, when they are no longer an easy source of income, and nothing is done to stop it from ever happening again,” continued DG Swing.

“It should never have happened in the first place. We should not have to wait for tragedies like these to show us that international cooperation must be enhanced to fight human smuggling – not just through policy but through real action along these smuggling routes. This is a busy and extremely dangerous smuggling route. Yemen is suffering one of today’s most dire humanitarian crises. Countries experiencing conflict or crisis like Yemen need greater support to reinforce law enforcement and humanitarian border management with the aim of protecting vulnerable migrants like these 16 year old kids. My thoughts are with their families and loved ones in Ethiopia and Somalia. I am making a promise to them that IOM will not forget them and will continue to fight to protect the rights and dignity of future generations of migrants,” concluded DG Swing.

Two people believed to be undocumented immigrants were found dead on ranches in Brooks County on Thursday.

Justice of the Peace Adela Quintanilla pronounced the two dead, and the remains were taken to the Webb County Coroner's Office, according to a news release from U.S. Border Patrol.

Monday, Rio Grande City agents responded to a call about a deceased person near La Grulla. The person was taken to Laredo for an autopsy. It is unclear where the person was from, the release stated.

Wednesday, Border Patrol agents in Kingsville were contacted by Kennedy County Sheriff's Office about a lost person. Agents used GPS coordinates to rescue the person. Agents offered medical attention but the person declined, the release stated.

Later that week, the Brooks County Sheriff's Office contacted the Falfurrias Border Patrol Station on Friday about a 911 call of two people who had been lost for about three days, the release stated. Border Patrol Search Trauma and Rescue unit agents with the help of an Air and Marine helicopter responded to the last known coordinates of the two.

The pilot located the two and provided basic medical services to them. They were both taken to the hospital for an evaluation, the release stated.

On Saturday during a routine patrol, Border Patrol agents in Kingsville discovered a Guatemalan national who was bitten by a snake. According the the news release, the person was trying to avoid the checkpoint by walking through brush when a snake bit him. He was air-lifted to the hospital for medical attention, the release stated.

Kingsville agents on Sunday also responded to assistance with a call about three lost people near Norias, which is about 57 miles south of Kingsville. When agents arrived, they saw two people running. Another person, a Salvadoran national, told agents he was unable to run because of pain in his leg. He was taken to the hospital, the release stated.

The Rio Grande Valley Sector urges immigrants not to jeopardize their lives by trusting smugglers to help them enter the United States or avoid a checkpoint, the release stated. They also encourage the public to help save lives by reporting suspicious activity by calling 800-863-9382."

North America,2017-08-25,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Unknown,Latin America / Caribbean (P),Vehicle accident / death linked to hazardous transport,United States of America,US-Mexico border crossing,"Interstate 8, near Jacumba, San Diego County, California",http://bit.ly/2kszkvt,1,"A California Highway Patrol cruiser. Courtesy CHP

The California Highway Patrol and the U.S. Border Patrol confirmed for the first time Friday that a man was killed last month when he was struck by a car on a remote stretch of Interstate 8, but the agencies offered different explanations of whether or not Border Patrol agents were pursuing the man before he was killed.

San Diego County Medical Examiner’s officials said Cristian Lopez- Gonzalez, 21, was killed about 9:20 p.m. Aug. 25 when he was hit by a car on eastbound I-8 in Jacumba while being pursued by Border Patrol agents. A CHP spokesman confirmed three Border Patrol agents were listed as witnesses to the crash, which happened just west of In-Ko-Pah Park Road a little before the steep grade into the desert.

But a Border Patrol spokesman said agents were not chasing Lopez- Gonzalez when he tried to cross the interstate on foot, but that an agent patrolling the area heard the crash and responded.

It’s unclear why Lopez-Gonzalez’s death was not reported at the time.

According to the medical examiner’s office, Border Patrol agents were chasing Lopez-Gonzalez and another man, identified by the CHP as a 29-year-old, “after they crossed into the United States from Mexico.”

“During the pursuit, the decedent ran across the eastbound lanes of (I- 8) in Jucumba and was struck by an oncoming vehicle at a rate of speed of approximately 70 miles per hour,” the medical examiner’s office said. “The decedent was then deflected into the median strip and the driver of the vehicle stopped and called 911.”

That driver was a 69-year-old Brawley man behind the wheel of a 2013 Ford Escape, CHP media information officer Kevin Pearlstein said. He sustained minor injuries in the collision but was not taken to a hospital.

But a CHP report of the incident was lacking a narrative of the crash and provided only some details, like listing Lopez-Gonzalez as being at-fault for causing the collision, Pearlstein said. It also listed four witnesses: Lopez-Gonzalez’s 29-year-old companion and three Border Patrol agents from the agency’s Boulevard substation.

Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Mark Endicott issued a statement Thursday to City News Service that said agents were not pursuing Lopez- Gonzalez.

“The U.S. Border Patrol confirms that Cristian Lopez-Gonzalez was struck by a vehicle and died on Aug. 25, 2017, on Interstate 8, near Jacumba, Calif.,” Endicott’s statement read. “A Border Patrol agent patrolling the area heard the accident, responded, and immediately called (emergency medical services) for assistance.”

Endicott would not elaborate on that statement Friday and said there was “no additional information to provide” when asked about the discrepancies between the Border Patrol statement and the reports from the medical examiner’s office and CHP.

Lopez-Gonzalez’s death came about three weeks before two other people were killed on a San Diego freeway after illegally crossing the border in San Ysidro. In that incident, a man and woman, both 30, fled from a van that crossed the international boundary the wrong way on Interstate 5 early on Sept. 17. They were struck by an SUV and died at the scene, while seven others inside the van were arrested.

A U.S. Border Patrol agent jumped in a canal Sunday to save a man swept away by fast currents in Downtown El Paso, but was unable to rescue a second man, officials said.

Two days, later the body of a man was found in a South El Paso canal.

U.S. Border Patrol camera operators spotted two men attempting to cross a canal near the Santa Fe Street Bridge at about 1:10 p.m. Sunday, Border Patrol officials said.

Agents saw the two men jump into the canal, which is known to pose a severe drowning threat due to “fast and treacherous” water currents, officials said.

After jumping in, the two men were immediately in distress, officials said.

The agents made several attempts to rescue the men, but they refused assistance and would not grab a rescue rope thrown to them by the agents, officials said.

The men continued to struggle to keep afloat in the strong current, became unresponsive and appeared to lose consciousness, officials said.

One of the agents wrapped a rope around his waist and entered the canal waters. The agent was able to rescue one of the men.

The man was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid, officials said. He was taken to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Agents searched the canal for several hours, but were unable to find the second man. The search eventually was called off.

On Tuesday, agents spotted a “life-less” body at about 6 a.m. floating near the water flow control gates near Delta Drive and Coles Street in South El Paso, Border Patrol and El Paso Fire Department officials said.

Agents contacted the Fire Department and the El Paso Police Department to assist in the recovery and investigation.

The Fire Department’s Water Rescue Team retrieved the body of the man, whose age is not known, at about 8:21 a.m., fire officials said.

Border Patrol officials said it is not known whether the man rescued Tuesday is the same one who jumped in the canal on Sunday.

According to Border Patrol officials, nine migrants have died this year in canals or in the Rio Grande attempting to cross into the U.S.

Agents have rescued 24 migrants this year in 18 rescue operations in the El Paso area, officials said.

“These incidents demonstrate the dangers of illegally crossing the border,” U.S. Border Patrol officials said.

Local officials are urging the public not to jump into the canal due to the dangerous currents.

“It only takes six inches of fast-moving water to knock down a person,” Fire Department Water Rescue Firefighter Mark McNulty said in a statement. “With the high amounts of rain we have been receiving in the region, there is much more water moving down the river. The water may appear to be moving slowly, but in fact, it is moving at a great speed. Plus, there’s the added danger of debris, mud and contaminants.”

Cuatro de las mujeres valientes que se ahogaron en el mar. Sus comunidades les lloran mientras el Gobierno no reconoce sus muertes #Justicia pic.twitter.com/zk3mWiQQ8P — Helena Maleno Garzón (@HelenaMaleno) 2 de septiembre de 2017





“MUY MUY CERCA DE LA PLAYA”

Al teléfono, este es el relato que Maleno hace de los acontecimientos:

“En la madrugada del 31 de agosto al 1 de septiembre, nos llama una persona de aquí diciendo que su familiar lleva una patera con 45 personas, utilizando el método conocido como “la desviación”, que es salir de la costa de Nador (Marruecos) e ir hacia la playa de Melilla. Es un método más seguro, ya que no vas a alta mar sino directamente a la playa de Melilla. Es un método que se usa tanto en Ceuta como en Melilla y del cual el ministro Zoido ha reconocido que se hacen devoluciones en caliente argumentando que es una práctica que está en la Ley.”

“De esas personas, comprobamos que 13 de ellas están en el CETI de Melilla, que, por lo visto, se tiraron al agua para ir nadando hacia la playa porque estaban muy cerca y fueron recogidas por la Guardia Civil. Más tarde nos llama un compañero y nos dice que hay 7 mujeres que han muerto, 5 congoleñas y 2 guineanas, fallecidas en las prácticas que se hacen en esa zona, que son las devoluciones en caliente en el agua. Logramos hablar con un superviviente que nos cuenta que estaban muy cerca de la playa y que llega la Guardia Civil y no les rescata, sino que les bloquea y espera que llegue la patrullera marroquí. Cuando llega se echan al agua para forzar el rescate, algo que no sucede.”

“Llegan informaciones contradictorias porque hay un medio marroquí que habla de 14 muertos. Nosotros sólo tenemos confirmadas 7 muertas. Cuatro de ellas han llegado a la morgue de Nador, el hospital El Hassani. Podemos confirmar la muerte de las 4 congoleñas, porque la comunidad congoleña nos confirma que en esa patera había solamente 8 mujeres y nos confirma la muerte de 4. Posiblemente una quinta se ha salvado. El presidente de la comunidad congoleña ya se ha trasladado al tanatorio del hospital de Nador para identificar los cadáveres.”

“La Delegación del Gobierno, por el momento, lo niega todo. Sólo admite que participó en un rescate. Sí hay un comunicado de ayer de la Delegación del Gobierno diciendo que una patera intentaba entrar con 40 personas, habla de su rescate, pero obvia las muertes.”

“Acabamos de hablar con dos de los detenidos supervivientes que están siendo desplazados al sur de manera forzosa, porque es lo que se hace. Nos cuenta que al llegar la patrullera marroquí muchos más se tiraron al agua, y entonces unos y otros empezaron a coger gente. Entendemos que los que sabían nadar llegaron a la playa, porque están en el CETI, pero claro, no pueden hablar. Si hablan, no salen del CETI de Melilla en la vida. Entendemos que la Guardia Civil rescata y se hace cargo de unos cuantos y la marina marroquí ata la Zodiac a su embarcación para arrastrarla fuera de lo que sospechamos eran las aguas españolas. Al atarla, la Zodiac vuelca y mueren las 7 mujeres.”

“Existen varios interrogantes aquí: primero, ¿dónde sucedió esto? Si, como afirman los supervivientes, estaban tan cerca de la playa, eran aguas españolas. Si no eran aguas españolas, ¿por qué sale la Guardia Civil a aguas marroquíes a bloquear a gente? Y si eran aguas españolas, ¿por qué la Guardia Civil no alerta a Salvamento marítimo de lo que está sucediendo? Y si la patrullera marroquí ha entrado en aguas españolas para recoger gente y se la está llevando, ¿cómo permite la Guardia Civil que la forma de rescate de una embarcación, que es a todas luces peligrosa porque no cumple las medidas de seguridad marítima, que se la lleve a rastras y poniéndola en riesgo? Sucediese como sucediese, se produjo delante de una autoridad española que hasta ahora no ha reportado ni reconocido la muerte de las 7 personas.”

LA DELEGACIÓN DEL GOBIERNO DECLARA

La conversación telefónica es breve. Al otro lado, habla una mujer en representación de la Delegación del Gobierno en Melilla:

–Tenemos la confirmación de que, en el rescate de la Guardia Civil de hace tres días en Melilla, murieron 7 mujeres. ¿Tienen ustedes información al respecto?

–No, aquí en Melilla no hay ningún cadáver.

–Parece que los cadáveres de cuatro de ellas están en este momento en Nador. Pero en el momento en el que caen al agua, allí hay una patrullera de la Guardia Civil española.

–Ahí lo que pasó fue esto: Jueves, 5 de la tarde, una embarcación va llegando a la zona próxima a Aguadú, que es el límite de la costa territorial de Melilla con la zona norte. Se tiran una serie de inmigrantes al agua, parece ser que entre 25 y 27. La Guardia Civil acude e interviene en un rescate humanitario. Rescata a 13 y se los trae hasta Melilla. Están aquí, en el CETI, y quedan bajo competencia del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, que es el que tiene la competencia de aplicar la Ley de Extranjería, y ya se irá viendo según cada uno lo que haya declarado, lo que haya pedido o lo que sea. Y hasta ahí yo puedo llegar. Luego lo que haya pasado, lo que haya en Marruecos… Yo de eso no sé nada y no tengo nada que decirte.

–Sin embargo, algunos supervivientes afirman que la Guardia Civil no prestó auxilio a las fallecidas.

–Yo de eso no sé nada.

–¿La embarcación de los inmigrantes estaba en aguas españolas?

–No te lo sé decir. Yo entiendo que venía de aguas marroquíes… Los que se tiraron al agua, no sé, cuando se pusieron a nadar, hasta dónde llegarían. La Guardia Civil rescató a 13 y de los demás se hizo cargo la patrullera marroquí, que también se hizo cargo de la embarcación, así como de los que nunca se tiraron al agua.

PRÁCTICA INHUMANA

El 31 de marzo de 2015 se publicó en el BOE un añadido a la Ley de Extranjería que enunciaba lo que se conoce como “devoluciones en caliente”. Decía así: “Los extranjeros que sean detectados en la línea fronteriza de la demarcación territorial de Ceuta o Melilla mientras intentan superar los elementos de contención fronterizos para cruzar irregularmente la frontera podrán ser rechazados a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España”.

El Consejo General de la Abogacía rechazó dicha práctica al considerar que vulneraba los derechos fundamentales de las personas. Sin ir más lejos, el 3 de enero de este 2017, dicho órgano volvió a recordar al Gobierno su oposición y las advertencias del Consejo de Europa al respecto: “Un vez más, la Abogacía Española quiere recordar que nuestro ordenamiento jurídico prohíbe las devoluciones sin realizar un procedimiento individualizado que garantice, entre otros derechos, la asistencia letrada. También reitera que todo procedimiento de devolución o de rechazo debe respetar la normativa internacional de derechos humanos y de protección internacional aplicada en España, y en consecuencia, seguir el ‘principio de no devolución’. La ausencia de procedimientos individuales impide identificar situaciones de vulnerabilidad, como menores, víctimas de trata, o solicitantes de protección internacional”.

Resulta evidente que ese “podrán ser rechazados a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España” no supone lo mismo en tierra que en el mar. Lo que sucede en el mar es lo siguiente: Si la embarcación de los inmigrantes se encuentra en aguas marroquíes, la Guardia Civil la bloquea hasta que llega una nave de la Marina marroquí. La ONG Caminando Fronteras ha denunciado repetidamente que en ese momento los inmigrantes se enfrentan a un riesgo extremo. En la situación descrita, las personas que viajan en la patera a menudo optan por saltar al mar.

En respuesta a una pregunta registrada en el Senado por Maribel Mora (Unidos Podemos), el Gobierno español admitió en mayo de este año que se trata de una práctica habitual.

PROTOCOLO LETAL

Sin embargo, no es este el método más inhumano llevado a cabo por las autoridades españolas a la hora de “rechazar” a los inmigrantes “a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España”.

Como recuerda Helena Maleno, “hay otros protocolos que también han sido reconocidos por las autoridades del Estado español, como el utilizado en el Caso Sonko”.

La madrugada del 26 de septiembre de 2007 Laucing Sonko, un senegalés de 29 años, murió después de que, como denunció la Comisión Española de Ayuda al Refugiado (CEAR), la Guardia Civil pinchara su salvavidas y lo devolviera indefenso al mar. Junto con otros tres inmigrantes, trataba de alcanzar Ceuta a nado.

Maleno explica los detalles de dichos métodos:

“Cuando la gente intentaba pasar a nado, lo hacía de dos en dos, y uno tiraba del otro. Normalmente era como un acuerdo entre dos personas –por ejemplo, una tenía dinero y compraba neoprenos, salvavidas o lo que hiciera falta, y la otra sabía nadar y tiraba de la otra—. Un chico costamarfileño tiraba de Sonko. El “protocolo” entonces era que los subían a la lancha de la Guardia Civil, les pinchaban los chalecos o lo que llevaran, y los volvían a tirar al agua para que regresaran a nado a la costa. Arrojaron a Sonko al agua. Antes habían tirado al chico costamarfileño que sabía nadar. Sonko no sabía nadar y gritaba, gritaba. Allí había dos personas más que sufrieron ese “protocolo” y a las que nosotros entrevistamos. Sonko gritaba y gritaba y al final un guardia civil se dio cuenta de que se agarraba diciendo “ayúdenme, ayúdenme, no sé nadar”. Cuando se tiró el guardia civil, Sonko ya estaba muerto.”

“De hecho, estaba en zona marroquí, pero en aquel momento los marroquíes dijeron que lo había matado la Guardia Civil y lo tenían que devolver a Ceuta. Y lo enterraron. Pero Sonko tenía familia en Almería, que intentó denunciar. Los tribunales de aquí cerraron cualquier posibilidad, pero el Comité contra la Tortura condenó al Estado español por el Caso Sonko en el año 2012. Y la Guardia Civil hablaba de “protocolos”. Alegaban que eso eran “protocolos” que se llevaban a cabo en la zona de fronteras.”

Un año después de la muerte de Sonko, la Audiencia Provincial de Cádiz en Ceuta había sobreseído el caso argumentando que la muerte se había producido en territorio marroquí.

RESPONSABLE PREMIADO

Esta muerte de siete mujeres sucedida en la madrugada del pasado 31 de agosto al 1 de septiembre es el suceso más grave tras lo que se vino a denominar la “tragedia del Tarajal” y en realidad fue una matanza.

La mañana del 6 de febrero de 2014, más de 200 personas procedentes de Marruecos intentaron alcanzar a nado la costa de Ceuta. Desde la playa ceutí de El Tarajal, 56 agentes de la Guardia Civil dispararon contra ellos, aún en el agua, 145 pelotas de goma y cinco botes de humo. Al menos 15 de los inmigrantes murieron.

El entonces director de la Guardia Civil, Arsenio Fernández de Mesa, mintió al asegurar que no se habían disparado pelotas de goma, pese a las evidencias incluso gráficas de lo contrario. El Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy jamás reconoció la matanza ni pidió disculpas. No cesaron a Fernández de Mesa ni él presentó su dimisión. En febrero de 2017 fue nombrado consejero de Red Eléctrica de España, donde consta como External Independent Director.

INTERIOR RESPONDE

Tras enviar varias preguntas al Ministerio del Interior sobre las muertes sucedidas en la actuación de la Guardia Civil y la Marina marroquí el pasado 31 de agosto junto a la costa de Melilla, Ctxt recibe respuesta telefónica. Esta es la conversación con el representante de Interior:

–¿Me podría dar la versión que tiene de los hechos el Ministerio del Interior?

–Esto ocurre a las 16:15 h., que es cuando se detecta que había una embarcación recreativa con personas de origen subsahariano a bordo. Es una patrulla de la Gendarmería Real de Marruecos la que se hace cargo de esta embarcación recreativa y, cuando la están trasladando hacia la costa, un número indeterminado de personas se lanza al agua. Estas personas que se lanzan al agua llevaban puesto un chaleco salvavidas. En esa área, en la zona, se encontraba una embarcación del Grupo de Actividades Subacuáticas de la Guardia Civil. Además de esa, se activa otra embarcación más para garantizar la seguridad de esas personas que se han tirado al agua. Finalmente, la Guardia Civil rescata en total a 13 personas, los 13 de ellos que se habían tirado al agua y que tenían chalecos. Y los recatan cuando estaban próximos a la playa, próximos al territorio de España, y todo esto ocurre en aguas marroquíes. La Guardia Civil rescata a 13 que son trasladados al puerto de Melilla.

–¿Y no les constan los muertos? ¿No tienen aviso ni información, ni siquiera por parte de la Gendarmería marroquí, sobre las personas que mueren durante dicha actuación? Es de suponer que la coordinación y la comunicación son constantes en estos operativos.

–La información que te puedo dar es esta: la Guardia Civil rescata a 13, el resto lo rescata la Gendarmería marroquí. La Gendarmería también rescata a varias personas, yo no sé exactamente el número, pero rescata a varias personas. Y cuando la Guardia Civil ve que las fuerzas auxiliares están ya remolcando esta embarcación recreativa, cuando la Guardia Civil se retira de la zona para ir al puerto de Melilla a llevar a esas 13 personas, no hay nadie en el agua.

–O sea, ¿el Ministerio del Interior puede garantizar que cuando la Guardia Civil se retira no queda nadie en el agua? No olvidemos que se trata de una operación de rescate en la que está participando, y por lo tanto, de la que es responsable.

–La Guardia Civil está ahí cuando un primer grupo de personas se lanza al agua y entonces proceden al rescate.

–Perdone que insista. ¿Puede el Ministerio asegurar que Interior no informa de estas muertes porque ni las conoce ni estaba presente?

–Lo que yo te puedo decir es que cuando la Guardia Civil abandona el lugar, no detecta a ninguna persona en el agua.

UNA OPERACIÓN NADA HABITUAL

Más allá de la extrañeza que despierta el hecho de que a Interior no le conste la muerte de al menos siete personas en una operación en la que participa, también resulta sorprendente la ausencia de Salvamento Marítimo.

El artículo 268 de la Ley de Puertos del Estado y de la Marina Mercante establece que son competencia de Salvamento Marítimo “los servicios de rescate, búsqueda y salvamento marítimo; prevención y lucha contra la contaminación del medio marino y control del tráfico marítimo”. Por esa razón, en teoría, dicho organismo, dependiente del Ministerio de Fomento, participa, de una u otra forma, en todas las operaciones de rescate en el mar llevadas a cabo por las autoridades españolas.

Sin embargo, en el caso de la actuación llevada a cabo por la Guardia Civil el pasado 31 de agosto que se saldó con la muerte de 7 mujeres, no solo no participó Salvamento Marítimo, sino que ni siquiera tuvo noticia de su existencia.

Desde el centro que Salvamento tiene en Almería se atiende la mayoría de las actuaciones referentes a Melilla. De la siguiente conversación con uno de los responsables allí se deduce que la actuación que nos ocupa no responde a los protocolos habituales.

–¿Es normal que no intervenga Salvamento Marítimo en la operación?

–Nosotros nos dedicamos a la búsqueda y rescate de personas, siempre y cuando se nos alerta. Pero es cierto que cualquier embarcación, del tamaño que sea, que transite la mar, que se encuentre con otra embarcación en peligro, su deber es automáticamente auxiliar. Se trata de una ley normalizada a través de los convenios internacionales, y del propio sentido común. La mejor unidad de rescate, en un momento dado, puede ser la más próxima. Llaman a Salvamento Marítimo, pero entre que se moviliza y se desplaza, lo primero que haría es indicar a la que se encuentra próxima que rescate y se mantenga permanentemente en contacto con nosotros. Lo primero es asegurar la integridad y la vida de esas personas.

–A la vista de lo que me explica, las actuaciones de “devolución en caliente” en el mar por parte de la Guardia Civil, en las que “bloquean” las embarcaciones hasta que llega la Marina marroquí, no parecen responder a ese deber inmediato de auxiliar. Más bien parecería lo contrario.

–La verdad es que nosotros no hemos tenido conocimiento de la patera de la que estamos hablando. Lo he seguido por las páginas de internet.

–¿Es eso normal?

–Nosotros trabajamos al alimón con la Guardia Civil, tanto aquí en Almería como en Granada o Melilla. Y estas prácticas ellos no las suelen hacer. Ellos rescatan a la par que nosotros. Siempre vamos juntos a atender estas cosas. Sinceramente, yo no sé qué ha podido suceder en esta ocasión.

–El Ministerio asegura que no tienen constancia, en todo el proceso, de que haya habido muertos. Aun en el caso de que las muertes se produjeran en aguas marroquíes, ¿no sería normal que la información entre los operativos de ambos países fuera constante?

–Sí, el intercambio de información debería ser fluido. En buena lógica, en una operación conjunta no puede haber ocultación de información. Y esto es aplicable a cualquier tipo de operación, no solamente de rescate en la mar.

–El proceder en este caso, ¿es habitual o se trata de una excepción? ¿Se ha actuado de forma infrecuente?

–Te puedo asegurar que en las operaciones en las que actuamos conjuntamente la Guardia Civil y Salvamento Marítimo, que son todas, la respuesta a las personas que están en riesgo en la mar es inmediata y se hace con todas las premisas de seguridad habidas y por haber. Y siempre se hace así.

–No en este caso.

–Es que este caso le aseguro que lo desconozco. No sé qué ha pasado aquí. Nosotros no hemos recibido ningún tipo de información ni alerta ni nada de nada.

–Lo cual es sumamente extraño, entiendo.

–Nosotros siempre trabajamos al alimón con la Guardia Civil. Cuando hay una operación de búsqueda y rescate, siempre nos han avisado. El procedimiento es que nosotros siempre vamos. En cuanto interceptan una embarcación, automáticamente nos llaman. Nosotros somos los competentes en rescatar personas en la mar. Siempre ha habido intercambio de información. Siempre hemos trabajado unidos. Por eso no sé qué puedo decir en este caso, lo desconozco. Obviamente no responde a la práctica habitual."

“Llegan informaciones contradictorias porque hay un medio marroquí que habla de 14 muertos. Nosotros sólo tenemos confirmadas 7 muertas.

Posiblemente una quinta se ha salvado. El presidente de la comunidad congoleña ya se ha trasladado al tanatorio del hospital de Nador para identificar los cadáveres.”

“La Delegación del Gobierno, por el momento, lo niega todo. Sólo admite que participó en un rescate. Sí hay un comunicado de ayer de la Delegación del Gobierno diciendo que una patera intentaba entrar con 40 personas, habla de su rescate, pero obvia las muertes.”

“Acabamos de hablar con dos de los detenidos supervivientes que están siendo desplazados al sur de manera forzosa, porque es lo que se hace. Nos cuenta que al llegar la patrullera marroquí muchos más se tiraron al agua, y entonces unos y otros empezaron a coger gente.

“Existen varios interrogantes aquí: primero, ¿dónde sucedió esto? Si, como afirman los supervivientes, estaban tan cerca de la playa, eran aguas españolas. Si no eran aguas españolas, ¿por qué sale la Guardia Civil a aguas marroquíes a bloquear a gente? Y si eran aguas españolas, ¿por qué la Guardia Civil no alerta a Salvamento marítimo de lo que está sucediendo? Y si la patrullera marroquí ha entrado en aguas españolas para recoger gente y se la está llevando, ¿cómo permite la Guardia Civil que la forma de rescate de una embarcación, que es a todas luces peligrosa porque no cumple las medidas de seguridad marítima, que se la lleve a rastras y poniéndola en riesgo? Sucediese como sucediese, se produjo delante de una autoridad española que hasta ahora no ha reportado ni reconocido la muerte de las 7 personas.”

LA DELEGACIÓN DEL GOBIERNO DECLARA

La conversación telefónica es breve. Al otro lado, habla una mujer en representación de la Delegación del Gobierno en Melilla:

–Tenemos la confirmación de que, en el rescate de la Guardia Civil de hace tres días en Melilla, murieron 7 mujeres. ¿Tienen ustedes información al respecto?

–No, aquí en Melilla no hay ningún cadáver.

–Parece que los cadáveres de cuatro de ellas están en este momento en Nador. Pero en el momento en el que caen al agua, allí hay una patrullera de la Guardia Civil española.

–Ahí lo que pasó fue esto: Jueves, 5 de la tarde, una embarcación va llegando a la zona próxima a Aguadú, que es el límite de la costa territorial de Melilla con la zona norte. Se tiran una serie de inmigrantes al agua, parece ser que entre 25 y 27. La Guardia Civil acude e interviene en un rescate humanitario. Rescata a 13 y se los trae hasta Melilla. Están aquí, en el CETI, y quedan bajo competencia del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, que es el que tiene la competencia de aplicar la Ley de Extranjería, y ya se irá viendo según cada uno lo que haya declarado, lo que haya pedido o lo que sea. Y hasta ahí yo puedo llegar. Luego lo que haya pasado, lo que haya en Marruecos… Yo de eso no sé nada y no tengo nada que decirte.

–Sin embargo, algunos supervivientes afirman que la Guardia Civil no prestó auxilio a las fallecidas.

–Yo de eso no sé nada.

–¿La embarcación de los inmigrantes estaba en aguas españolas?

–No te lo sé decir. Yo entiendo que venía de aguas marroquíes… Los que se tiraron al agua, no sé, cuando se pusieron a nadar, hasta dónde llegarían. La Guardia Civil rescató a 13 y de los demás se hizo cargo la patrullera marroquí, que también se hizo cargo de la embarcación, así como de los que nunca se tiraron al agua.

PRÁCTICA INHUMANA

El 31 de marzo de 2015 se publicó en el BOE un añadido a la Ley de Extranjería que enunciaba lo que se conoce como “devoluciones en caliente”. Decía así: “Los extranjeros que sean detectados en la línea fronteriza de la demarcación territorial de Ceuta o Melilla mientras intentan superar los elementos de contención fronterizos para cruzar irregularmente la frontera podrán ser rechazados a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España”.

El Consejo General de la Abogacía rechazó dicha práctica al considerar que vulneraba los derechos fundamentales de las personas. Sin ir más lejos, el 3 de enero de este 2017, dicho órgano volvió a recordar al Gobierno su oposición y las advertencias del Consejo de Europa al respecto: “Un vez más, la Abogacía Española quiere recordar que nuestro ordenamiento jurídico prohíbe las devoluciones sin realizar un procedimiento individualizado que garantice, entre otros derechos, la asistencia letrada. También reitera que todo procedimiento de devolución o de rechazo debe respetar la normativa internacional de derechos humanos y de protección internacional aplicada en España, y en consecuencia, seguir el ‘principio de no devolución’. La ausencia de procedimientos individuales impide identificar situaciones de vulnerabilidad, como menores, víctimas de trata, o solicitantes de protección internacional”.

Resulta evidente que ese “podrán ser rechazados a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España” no supone lo mismo en tierra que en el mar. Lo que sucede en el mar es lo siguiente: Si la embarcación de los inmigrantes se encuentra en aguas marroquíes, la Guardia Civil la bloquea hasta que llega una nave de la Marina marroquí. La ONG Caminando Fronteras ha denunciado repetidamente que en ese momento los inmigrantes se enfrentan a un riesgo extremo.

En respuesta a una pregunta registrada en el Senado por Maribel Mora (Unidos Podemos), el Gobierno español admitió en mayo de este año que se trata de una práctica habitual.

PROTOCOLO LETAL

Sin embargo, no es este el método más inhumano llevado a cabo por las autoridades españolas a la hora de “rechazar” a los inmigrantes “a fin de impedir su entrada ilegal en España”.

Como recuerda Helena Maleno, “hay otros protocolos que también han sido reconocidos por las autoridades del Estado español, como el utilizado en el Caso Sonko”.

La madrugada del 26 de septiembre de 2007 Laucing Sonko, un senegalés de 29 años, murió después de que, como denunció la Comisión Española de Ayuda al Refugiado (CEAR), la Guardia Civil pinchara su salvavidas y lo devolviera indefenso al mar. Junto con otros tres inmigrantes, trataba de alcanzar Ceuta a nado.

Maleno explica los detalles de dichos métodos:

“Cuando la gente intentaba pasar a nado, lo hacía de dos en dos, y uno tiraba del otro. Normalmente era como un acuerdo entre dos personas –por ejemplo, una tenía dinero y compraba neoprenos, salvavidas o lo que hiciera falta, y la otra sabía nadar y tiraba de la otra—. Un chico costamarfileño tiraba de Sonko. El “protocolo” entonces era que los subían a la lancha de la Guardia Civil, les pinchaban los chalecos o lo que llevaran, y los volvían a tirar al agua para que regresaran a nado a la costa. Arrojaron a Sonko al agua. Antes habían tirado al chico costamarfileño que sabía nadar. Sonko no sabía nadar y gritaba, gritaba. Allí había dos personas más que sufrieron ese “protocolo” y a las que nosotros entrevistamos. Sonko gritaba y gritaba y al final un guardia civil se dio cuenta de que se agarraba diciendo “ayúdenme, ayúdenme, no sé nadar”. Cuando se tiró el guardia civil, Sonko ya estaba muerto.”

“De hecho, estaba en zona marroquí, pero en aquel momento los marroquíes dijeron que lo había matado la Guardia Civil y lo tenían que devolver a Ceuta. Y lo enterraron. Pero Sonko tenía familia en Almería, que intentó denunciar. Los tribunales de aquí cerraron cualquier posibilidad, pero el Comité contra la Tortura condenó al Estado español por el Caso Sonko en el año 2012. Y la Guardia Civil hablaba de “protocolos”. Alegaban que eso eran “protocolos” que se llevaban a cabo en la zona de fronteras.”

Un año después de la muerte de Sonko, la Audiencia Provincial de Cádiz en Ceuta había sobreseído el caso argumentando que la muerte se había producido en territorio marroquí.

RESPONSABLE PREMIADO

Esta muerte de siete mujeres sucedida en la madrugada del pasado 31 de agosto al 1 de septiembre es el suceso más grave tras lo que se vino a denominar la “tragedia del Tarajal” y en realidad fue una matanza.

La mañana del 6 de febrero de 2014, más de 200 personas procedentes de Marruecos intentaron alcanzar a nado la costa de Ceuta. Desde la playa ceutí de El Tarajal, 56 agentes de la Guardia Civil dispararon contra ellos, aún en el agua, 145 pelotas de goma y cinco botes de humo. Al menos 15 de los inmigrantes murieron.

El entonces director de la Guardia Civil, Arsenio Fernández de Mesa, mintió al asegurar que no se habían disparado pelotas de goma, pese a las evidencias incluso gráficas de lo contrario. El Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy jamás reconoció la matanza ni pidió disculpas. No cesaron a Fernández de Mesa ni él presentó su dimisión. En febrero de 2017 fue nombrado consejero de Red Eléctrica de España, donde consta como External Independent Director.

INTERIOR RESPONDE

Tras enviar varias preguntas al Ministerio del Interior sobre las muertes sucedidas en la actuación de la Guardia Civil y la Marina marroquí el pasado 31 de agosto junto a la costa de Melilla, Ctxt recibe respuesta telefónica. Esta es la conversación con el representante de Interior:

–¿Me podría dar la versión que tiene de los hechos el Ministerio del Interior?

–Esto ocurre a las 16:15 h., que es cuando se detecta que había una embarcación recreativa con personas de origen subsahariano a bordo. Es una patrulla de la Gendarmería Real de Marruecos la que se hace cargo de esta embarcación recreativa y, cuando la están trasladando hacia la costa, un número indeterminado de personas se lanza al agua. Estas personas que se lanzan al agua llevaban puesto un chaleco salvavidas. En esa área, en la zona, se encontraba una embarcación del Grupo de Actividades Subacuáticas de la Guardia Civil. Además de esa, se activa otra embarcación más para garantizar la seguridad de esas personas que se han tirado al agua. Finalmente, la Guardia Civil rescata en total a 13 personas, los 13 de ellos que se habían tirado al agua y que tenían chalecos. Y los recatan cuando estaban próximos a la playa, próximos al territorio de España, y todo esto ocurre en aguas marroquíes. La Guardia Civil rescata a 13 que son trasladados al puerto de Melilla.

–¿Y no les constan los muertos? ¿No tienen aviso ni información, ni siquiera por parte de la Gendarmería marroquí, sobre las personas que mueren durante dicha actuación? Es de suponer que la coordinación y la comunicación son constantes en estos operativos.

–La información que te puedo dar es esta: la Guardia Civil rescata a 13, el resto lo rescata la Gendarmería marroquí. La Gendarmería también rescata a varias personas, yo no sé exactamente el número, pero rescata a varias personas. Y cuando la Guardia Civil ve que las fuerzas auxiliares están ya remolcando esta embarcación recreativa, cuando la Guardia Civil se retira de la zona para ir al puerto de Melilla a llevar a esas 13 personas, no hay nadie en el agua.

–O sea, ¿el Ministerio del Interior puede garantizar que cuando la Guardia Civil se retira no queda nadie en el agua? No olvidemos que se trata de una operación de rescate en la que está participando, y por lo tanto, de la que es responsable.

–La Guardia Civil está ahí cuando un primer grupo de personas se lanza al agua y entonces proceden al rescate.

–Perdone que insista. ¿Puede el Ministerio asegurar que Interior no informa de estas muertes porque ni las conoce ni estaba presente?

–Lo que yo te puedo decir es que cuando la Guardia Civil abandona el lugar, no detecta a ninguna persona en el agua.

UNA OPERACIÓN NADA HABITUAL

Más allá de la extrañeza que despierta el hecho de que a Interior no le conste la muerte de al menos siete personas en una operación en la que participa, también resulta sorprendente la ausencia de Salvamento Marítimo.

El artículo 268 de la Ley de Puertos del Estado y de la Marina Mercante establece que son competencia de Salvamento Marítimo “los servicios de rescate, búsqueda y salvamento marítimo; prevención y lucha contra la contaminación del medio marino y control del tráfico marítimo”. Por esa razón, en teoría, dicho organismo, dependiente del Ministerio de Fomento, participa, de una u otra forma, en todas las operaciones de rescate en el mar llevadas a cabo por las autoridades españolas.

Sin embargo, en el caso de la actuación llevada a cabo por la Guardia Civil el pasado 31 de agosto que se saldó con la muerte de 7 mujeres, no solo no participó Salvamento Marítimo, sino que ni siquiera tuvo noticia de su existencia.

Desde el centro que Salvamento tiene en Almería se atiende la mayoría de las actuaciones referentes a Melilla. De la siguiente conversación con uno de los responsables allí se deduce que la actuación que nos ocupa no responde a los protocolos habituales.

–¿Es normal que no intervenga Salvamento Marítimo en la operación?

–Nosotros nos dedicamos a la búsqueda y rescate de personas, siempre y cuando se nos alerta. Pero es cierto que cualquier embarcación, del tamaño que sea, que transite la mar, que se encuentre con otra embarcación en peligro, su deber es automáticamente auxiliar. Se trata de una ley normalizada a través de los convenios internacionales, y del propio sentido común. La mejor unidad de rescate, en un momento dado, puede ser la más próxima. Llaman a Salvamento Marítimo, pero entre que se moviliza y se desplaza, lo primero que haría es indicar a la que se encuentra próxima que rescate y se mantenga permanentemente en contacto con nosotros. Lo primero es asegurar la integridad y la vida de esas personas.

–A la vista de lo que me explica, las actuaciones de “devolución en caliente” en el mar por parte de la Guardia Civil, en las que “bloquean” las embarcaciones hasta que llega la Marina marroquí, no parecen responder a ese deber inmediato de auxiliar. Más bien parecería lo contrario.

–La verdad es que nosotros no hemos tenido conocimiento de la patera de la que estamos hablando. Lo he seguido por las páginas de internet.

–¿Es eso normal?

–Nosotros trabajamos al alimón con la Guardia Civil, tanto aquí en Almería como en Granada o Melilla. Y estas prácticas ellos no las suelen hacer. Ellos rescatan a la par que nosotros. Siempre vamos juntos a atender estas cosas. Sinceramente, yo no sé qué ha podido suceder en esta ocasión.

–El Ministerio asegura que no tienen constancia, en todo el proceso, de que haya habido muertos. Aun en el caso de que las muertes se produjeran en aguas marroquíes, ¿no sería normal que la información entre los operativos de ambos países fuera constante?

–Sí, el intercambio de información debería ser fluido. En buena lógica, en una operación conjunta no puede haber ocultación de información. Y esto es aplicable a cualquier tipo de operación, no solamente de rescate en la mar.

–El proceder en este caso, ¿es habitual o se trata de una excepción? ¿Se ha actuado de forma infrecuente?

–Te puedo asegurar que en las operaciones en las que actuamos conjuntamente la Guardia Civil y Salvamento Marítimo, que son todas, la respuesta a las personas que están en riesgo en la mar es inmediata y se hace con todas las premisas de seguridad habidas y por haber. Y siempre se hace así.

–No en este caso.

–Es que este caso le aseguro que lo desconozco. No sé qué ha pasado aquí. Nosotros no hemos recibido ningún tipo de información ni alerta ni nada de nada.

–Lo cual es sumamente extraño, entiendo.

–Nosotros siempre trabajamos al alimón con la Guardia Civil. Cuando hay una operación de búsqueda y rescate, siempre nos han avisado. El procedimiento es que nosotros siempre vamos. En cuanto interceptan una embarcación, automáticamente nos llaman. Nosotros somos los competentes en rescatar personas en la mar. Siempre ha habido intercambio de información. Siempre hemos trabajado unidos. Por eso no sé qué puedo decir en este caso, lo desconozco. Obviamente no responde a la práctica habitual."

Two women and a minor boy of Rohingya community drowned and three others went missing as a boat carrying the fleeing Rohingyas capsized in Naf River in Hwaikong Bazar area of Teknaf this evening.

The deceased were identified as Fatema Begum, 63, and her daughter Minara Begum, 25, our Cox’s Bazar staff correspondent reports quoting sub-inspector Md Mahir Khan, in-charge of Hwaikong Police out post.

The minor boy, aged around four to five, was yet to be identified, the SI said.

According to Syed Ullah, husband of Fatema, a boat started from Myanmar with a total of seven people reached the Hwaikong area and sank leaving the two women dead and four others went missing, the police officer said.

Later, locals found the body of the minor boy Khagongkhali area, adjacent to Naf River, around 7:30pm and buried him, SI Mahir told this correspondent.

Earlier in the day, members of Border Guard Bangladesh stopped 1,091 more Rohingyas from entering Bangladesh, said Commanding Officer of BGB Battalion-2 Lt Col SM Ariful Islam.

So far, 53 Rohingyas have been killed in three separate incidents of boat capsize at Shah Porir Dwip.

According to UN refugee agency UNHCR, about 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar’s trouble-torn Rakhine state seeking shelter since the outbreak of violence there."

(New York) – Burmese security forces have laid landmines during attacks on villages and along the Bangladesh border, posing a grave risk to Rohingya Muslims fleeing atrocities, Human Rights Watch said today. The Burmese government should immediately stop using antipersonnel landmines and join the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.



“The dangers faced by thousands of Rohingya fleeing atrocities in Burma are deadly enough without adding landmines to the mix,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. “The Burmese military needs to stop using these banned weapons, which kill and maim without distinction.”



According to witness accounts, independent reporting, and photo and video recordings, Burmese soldiers have in recent weeks laid antipersonnel landmines at key crossing points on Burma’s border with Bangladesh. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that Burmese military personnel also planted mines on roads inside northern Rakhine State prior to their attacks on predominantly Rohingya villages. The Burmese government has accused the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) of using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against infrastructure and security forces.





Placing landmines in the path of fleeing refugees and on roads where families are likely to travel is heartless beyond words. Meenakshi Ganguly South Asia Director

I believe everyone is aware that landmines should not be used in Myanmar, considering the serious effects that they have not only on troops in combat, but also on non-combatant civilians who are tending to their daily survival and livelihood – mothers, fathers, and their children. In order to prevent this the Tat Ma Daw [Burmese armed forces], as well as soldiers in combat – meaning all parties engaged in armed conflict – must make their decision to cease the way of mines.

Two Rohingya refugees from inner areas of Rakhine State, one from Buthidaung and another from Rathedaung township, told Human Rights Watch they saw the Burmese military laying antipersonnel mines on roads as the military entered and attacked villagers. “Mohammad,” 39, said he saw a neighbor’s son step on one of the mines laid by the military. The mine blew his right leg off.On September 4, 2017, a landmine detonated on a path used by many refugees near the hamlets of Taung Pyo Let Yar, about 200 meters from the Bangladesh border. Human Rights Watch witnessed smoke arising from the hamlets, suggesting burning by the military that caused villagers to flee. The next day, three Rohingya men were wounded in three separate landmine explosions near the same border point.Two Rohingya refugees told Human Rights Watch that men in apparent Burmese military uniforms were seen in the northern part of Taung Pyo Let Yar performing some activity on the ground prior to the September 4 explosions. One described watching a Burmese military patrol on the road near the border on the morning of September 4. From a vantage point in so-called no-man’s land, he observed several soldiers from the patrol stop at least twice, kneel down on the ground, dig into the ground with a knife, and place a dark item into the earth.Since late August, Burmese security forces, following a coordinated attack by ARSA militants, have carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing involving mass arson killing , and other abuses against the Rohingya population, causing the flight of more than 420,000 people to neighboring Bangladesh.Human Rights Watch has called on members of the United Nations Security Council to hold a public meeting and adopt a resolution that condemns the Burmese military’s ethnic cleansing campaign and threatens to impose further measures, including targeted sanctions on military leaders and an arms embargo.In April 2017, news media reported that the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments agreed to remove landmines and IEDs from the border area. On September 6, the Bangladesh government protested the recent use of landmines on the border by Burmese security forces. In her September 21 address to the UN General Assembly in New York, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused Burma of laying landmines along the border to prevent Rohingya from fleeing the violence. According to Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officials, at least five people have been killed and 12 injured from landmine blasts.The Landmine Monitor reported that Burmese security forces have consistently used antipersonnel mines in numerous locations along the Bangladesh-Burma border since 1999, but this use had been abating in recent years. In September 2016, Deputy Minister of Defense Maj. Gen. Myint Nwe informed parliament that the army continues to use landmines in fighting with ethnic minority armed groups.The use of antipersonnel landmines is banned by the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty . Bangladesh is a party to the treaty and destroyed its landmine stocks in accordance with its treaty obligations. Although Burma is not a party to the treaty, these weapons are unlawful because they cannot discriminate between civilians and combatants, and will kill and maim civilians long after they are placed. The Burmese government has not substantively responded to the allegations, but Zaw Htay, spokesman for de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, suggested that Rohingya militants might be responsible . Rakhine State Security and Border Affairs Minister Col. Phone Tint denied allegations that government forces were laying landmines, and blamed ARSA: “There’s no landmine planted by the military in the area. The terrorists planted the landmines. The military will never do that.”In a February 2011 statement on the landmine ban, Aung San Suu Kyi told the International Campaign to Ban Landmines:

“Placing landmines in the path of fleeing refugees and on roads where families are likely to travel is heartless beyond words,” Ganguly said. “The Burmese government should immediately end its ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya population, including by immediately clearing landmines in northern Rakhine State.”



Human Rights Watch is a co-founder and chair of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to bring about the Mine Ban Treaty and its contributions to a new international diplomacy based on humanitarian imperatives.





Recent Cases of Landmine Use in Rakhine State

Sabikam Nahor, approximately 45, lost both of her legs below the knees after stepping on an antipersonnel landmine laid inside Burma near the Bangladesh border. She told Human Rights Watch that the incident occurred on the afternoon of September 4, 2017, after the Burmese military attacked her village, in the northern part of Taung Pyo Let Yar. Nahor said that she was in an outdoor latrine when she heard the shooting and ran toward the Bangladesh border nearby. She said that she had used the same path on many occasions before when she would go to markets across the border. Nahor said she was running when there was a sudden explosion as she stepped on the ground. She fell and, from the ground, saw one of her legs detached from her body. Several Rohingya picked her up and took her across the border, and from there she was transported to a hospital.



Subir Ahmed, 55, said that on August 28, his son, Azizul Huq, 15, stepped on a landmine and was killed within 60 meters of the Bangladesh border. Subir said that his son and his brother were separated from the family on August 25, after at least 30 Burmese soldiers arrived in their home of Taung Pyo Let Yar and opened fire on villagers who had just finished morning prayers. While waiting for his son at the border at Thiang Khali in Bangladesh, Subir heard a loud blast and then saw Azizul Huq lying on the ground near his brother. Subir rushed to where his son was lying on the ground and picked him up, leaving the remains of the boy’s shattered legs behind. Subir Ahmed noted that at least once a year, he had traveled on the same path to transport fish to markets in Bangladesh.



Mohammad said that the son of his neighbor, Noor Islam, was a victim of antipersonnel mines on August 29 at about midday in Buthidaung township. He said they were not aware that mines were in the area. “I saw his right leg was gone,” Mohammad said. “I saw the mines explode with my own eyes on the road.” Mohammad said he had traveled on the same road the day before the fighting broke out, and that at that time it was safe.



Military Placing of Landmines

The refugee who witnessed soldiers digging in the northern part of Taung Pyo Let Yar which borders Bangladesh said that he continued to monitor the activities of the military patrol, and went to several sites where he observed similar activities. He said that from September 4 to 10 he removed several antipersonnel mines from the ground, and used rocks to detonate another three mines.

Senior Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officers said that they observed similar activities by Burmese soldiers over several days before September 4. They alleged that Burmese officials acted contrary to border agreements and protocols by failing to notify their Bangladeshi counterparts in advance of entering the border area.Refugees also described seeing landmines on other paths in no-man’s land. Human Rights Watch obtained images of emplaced PMN-1 type antipersonnel blast mines along the fence on the Burma side of the border. From the images alone, Human Rights Watch was not able to determine the origins of these PMN-1 type mines, particularly whether they were copies of the Soviet design produced by China (Type 58) or by Burma (MM-2).In addition to mine-laying on the border, Human Rights Watch received credible accounts from two Rohingya who described the use of antipersonnel landmines on roads in Buthidaung township after August 25, just before the military started attacking villages, hindering flight from the villages.“Rohim,” 52, described soldiers arriving by foot and in trucks to Chut Pyin, Rathedaung, in the early morning of August 25. He said that the soldiers were working in teams and placed landmines on the road outside his large, mud-walled house. “When they are coming, some are in four-man teams, some in 10-man teams, and some were sitting, digging, and putting mines in the roads,” said Rohim. He said they only laid mines in the roads, which prevented villagers from using the roads as they fled heavy gunfire and other attacks by the military.Mohammad said that in addition to attacking his village with gunfire and other explosive weapons on the night of August 26, the military emplaced antipersonnel mines on the road in Taung Bazar, Buthidaung. He said that mines were placed near the hospital."

On Sunday, Sept. 17, at approximately 1:45 a.m., U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry observed a white van traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of Interstate 5 and activated the port runner alarm system at the port of entry.

CBP officers in a pre-positioned pursuit vehicle left the port of entry traveling northbound in the northbound lanes of the I-5, spotted the vehicle stopped on the opposite side of the highway, exited the freeway and drove to the site. CBP officers notified California Highway Patrol and U.S. Border Patrol of the incident, and both responded.

U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended seven individuals, near the scene, who had abandoned the vehicle. They included six Mexican nationals - three male minors, and men ages 18, 27 and 34 - as well as one 24-year-old male Chinese national, all of whom had illegally entered the U.S.

Two additional people, a man and a woman, who had also abandoned the van, were struck by a vehicle traveling southbound on the highway and were pronounced dead at the scene by arriving Emergency Medical Services responders. Both were later identified as Mexican citizens, both 30, with no legal status in the United States. California Highway Patrol responded to the scene and conducted an investigation into the accident.

One of the seven people apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents was identified as the suspected driver of the van, a 34-year-old man, who will face federal prosecution. CBP officers also seized the van, a 1999 Dodge Caravan with no license plates."

Dos jóvenes migrantes fallecieron en la madrugada del sábado al domingo cerca de Beni Enzar asfixiados por los gases que lanzaron contra ellos agentes de las Fuerzas de Seguridad del país vecino. Así lo aseguró ayer la activista Helena Maleno que explicó que junto a estos dos hombres había otros cuatro que tuvieron que ser atendidos en el Hospital.



Maleno indicó que según las versiones que han dado los supervivientes, el grupo de migrantes pretendía cruzar hasta nuestra ciudad por una especie de túnel o antigua alcantarilla localizado cerca de Beni Enzar. Según contaron estos jóvenes, varias personas les habían dicho que por esa zona se podía atravesar hasta el lado español sin problemas.













Sin embargo, una vez dentro comprobaron que no había salida al otro lado y los agentes gasearon la zona para tratar de obligarlos a salir. Esto provocó que dos de los hombres murieran, mientras que el resto fueron atendidos por los sanitarios.











Todos del mismo pueblo



La activista indicó que todos los muchachos eran del mismo pueblo y dijo que ya se había avisado a las familias de los dos fallecidos sobre lo ocurrido.



Maleno explicó que los muchachos son muy jóvenes, por lo que están intentando averiguar si alguno podría ser menor de edad, aunque por el momento no han podido confirmarlo.



La activista señaló, además, que, según las últimas informaciones que han tenido, los cuatro migrantes que salieron con vida ya han sido dados de alta en el hospital en el que recibieron atención médica.



Maleno apuntó que no tienen claro dónde se produjo exactamente el suceso y que inicialmente pensaron que había sido intentando saltar la valla, aunque más tarde al hablar con los supervivientes comprobaron que no. De lo que no tiene dudas, eso sí, es de que los jóvenes fueron gaseados y que hubo dos fallecidos."

Attackers opened fire on a minibus carrying migrants who had entered Turkey via an illegal route in Ağrı’s Doğubayazıt district, according to the source.



Turkish gendarmerie forces detained 10 passengers, but the driver and others in the vehicle managed to escape.



Authorities have been conducting a search to find the attackers and the remaining passengers as the injured were taken to a hospital.

Security forces told Anadolu Agency that the terrorist group fired some 32 mortar rounds across the border from northern Iraq on the Derecik Border Battalion Command in Şemdinli district of southeastern Hakkari province.

One of the shells landed in an area near the military zone's entrance, where illegal migrants, including Syrian nationals, were being held for border procedures

One Syrian was killed in the blast, whereas five others were injured and taken to hospitals. Two of the injured remain in critical condition.

The military launched an air-backed operation to capture the terrorists.

The PKK terrorist organization has waged a terror campaign against the Turkish state for more than 30 years that has led to the deaths of more than 40,000 people.

Designated as a terrorist group by the U.S, Turkey and the EU, the PKK is also involved in the production and trafficking of illegal drugs.

According to Turkey, the PYD and its armed wing the People's Protection Units (YPG) are also terrorist groups, considered the Syrian offshoots of the PKK.

However, the U.S. considers the PYD/YPG to be a ""reliable partner"" in the fight on the ground in Syria and continues to support them in the field. The terrorist group currently operates in northern Syria and controls areas of land near the Turkish border."

Cox’s Bazar – A boat packed with approximately 100 Rohingya desperately escaping violence in Myanmar capsized in the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal this evening (28/09), while en route to Bangladesh. The remains of 15 Rohingya - nine children, five adult women and one adult man - were recovered off the shores of Ukhiya, Bangladesh, near the village of Shamlapur.

Local community members saw the boat capsize and were able to immediately launch rescue operations. Fire and civil defence services, as well as, Shamlapur community members, rescued some 17 people – ten of whom have been hospitalized. IOM, the UN Migration Agency’s local team travelled to the scene to see what immediate support was required by survivors and to assess how IOM could respond.

IOM staff found Khadija Begum*, a 22-year-old female survivor, in a local grocery shop. They approached her and sensitively asked her in the Ukhiya dialect, which is similar to her own, if she needed help. Still in shock, she was waiting as the rescue operations continued. Gradually, she recounted what happened. Khadija Begum said that among the rescued children, who have not been hospitalized, one is hers and five are her neighbours' children. Khadija Begum also said that one of her own children, a baby of eight months, was drowned when the boat capsized and that her 35-year-old husband, Abdul, is one of the ten people, who had been hospitalized. Khadija Begum's mother-in-law, 55 years old, was also drowned, as was her 30-year-old sister-in-law along with her 4-year-old child.

She said that they had boarded the boat yesterday evening and had been on it for about a day.

Leaving their village in Rakhine State, Myanmar, they walked for two days and two nights to reach the place, where the boat embarked from. There was about 100 people on board – although it could have been more - of whom, she said the majority were children.

They had been floating in the sea all night (27/09) with no food. Afraid of being detected by authorities, the captain did not try to anchor the boat near the shore until late this afternoon (28/09). He had been searching for an unguarded point. At 5:00pm today (Bangladesh), while trying to anchor the boat, and given how rough the seas currently are from torrential wind and rain, the captain lost control of the boat and it capsized. The incident happened very close to the shore but where the water was still dangerously deep. Local community members saw the boat capsize and were able to immediately launch rescue operations. The boat was destroyed and washed away.

“These people thought they had finally arrived to safety but died before even touching land,” said Abdullah Al Mamoun, one of the IOM staff members who travelled to the scene, where he saw the remains.

Khadija Begum said that the captain was a Bangladeshi man, who was missing since the incident. She also said that the amount they were meant to pay for the journey was not fixed. They were to pay the captain once he got them to safety and before getting off the boat, which never happened.

The IOM team liaised with local authorities and other UN agencies to ensure the survivors, who did not need to be hospitalized, had somewhere to go. They are now being taken care by a member of the local civil council. This is a temporary arrangement and longer term assistance and shelter is currently being discussed.

The fate of the other approximately 68 Rohingya on the boat remains unknown as torrential wind and rain continues. Community members, police, border control and fire service are all still on the scene as they are expecting the remains of more victims to wash up on the shore. They are also hoping to rescue more survivors.

The Shamlapur fishing village, some 35 kilometres south of Cox’s Bazar, is where many Rohingya have settled in makeshift homes during past influxes – now living amongst the Bengal community. Since violence flared on August 25, at least 501,800** Rohingya have fled from Northern Rakhine State, Myanmar, into Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Rohingya enter the country through a variety of crossing points, including land and marine routes in coastal areas on the Bay of Bengal, as well as over the Naf River in Teknaf, a sub-district of Cox’s Bazar.

Now in the midst of the monsoon rainy season, this journey is especially hazardous and deadly as this tragedy underscores.

Most of the half a million newly arrived Rohingya live in Kutupalong and the surrounding hillocks in tent cities and overcrowded make-shift settlement. IOM is leading the humanitarian response in Cox’s Bazar. Emergency response in the settlements is being scaled up to meet the enormous health, safety and security needs, but the needs far outstrip the current capacity in country. IOM is also conducting site planning for the new temporary displacement site on land allocated by the Government of Bangladesh near the Kutupalong Makeshift Settlement, as well as allocating and building up site management capacity in existing makeshift and new spontaneous sites. One of the biggest challenges to addresses needs in Bangladesh is lack of funding. The UN will be launching an updated inter-agency appeal in the coming week.

Western Asia,2017-09-30,6.0,,6,,,4.0,2.0,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Violence,Syrian Arab Republic,Syria to Türkiye,"Syria-Türkiye border at al-Dirriyah, Daraa Governorate, Syria",https://bit.ly/2IFZjr8,4,"Click to expand Image A Turkish soldier surveys the border line between Turkey and Syria near the city of Kilis, March 2, 2017. © 2017 Reuters/Murad Sezer

(Brussels) – Turkish security forces have routinely intercepted hundreds, and at times thousands, of asylum seekers at the Turkey-Syria border since at least December 2017 and summarily deported them to the war-ravaged Idlib governorate in Syria, Human Rights Watch said today. Turkish border guards have shot at asylum seekers trying to enter Turkey using smuggling routes, killing and wounding them, and have deported to Idlib newly arrived Syrians in the Turkish town of Antakya, 30 kilometers from the Syrian border.

The Russian-Syrian military alliance’s December offensive against anti-government forces in Idlib has displaced almost 400,000 civilians, according to the UN. They have joined more than 1.3 million others trapped inside Idlib in insecure, overcrowded camps, and in makeshift camps in fields near the closed Turkish border where they are under constant threat of attack and lack food, clean water, shelter, health care, and aid. At a March 26, 2018 summit meeting in Bulgaria, the European Union should press Turkey to allow Syrian civilians fleeing fighting to seek protection inside Turkey and pledge increased aid to Syrian refugees in Turkey and the region.

“As border guards try to seal the last remaining gaps in Turkey’s border, hundreds of thousands of Syrians are trapped in fields to face the bombs on the Syrian side,” said Gerry Simpson, associate refugee rights program director at Human Rights Watch. “The EU should press Turkey to open its border to those in need, and provide meaningful support, not silently stand by as Turkey ignores refugee law and pushes thousands back to face the carnage.”

In response to these allegations, the Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) in Turkey’s Ministry of Interior provided Human Rights Watch with a lengthy statement , which said, in part, that “while maintaining the security of borders against terrorist organizations, Turkey continues to accept Syrians in need coming to the borders, and never opens fire on or uses violence against them.”

The DGGM said that it registered 510,448 Syrians coming through the designated border gates in 2017, and 91,866 so far in 2018, and provided them with temporary protection. As seen from the numbers, the DGMM statement said, “allegations suggesting that Syrians are not registered are not true.” It does not appear that Turkish authorities conducted an investigation into Human Rights Watch’s specific findings.

In mid-February, Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with 21 Syrians about their repeated failed attempts to cross into Turkey with smugglers. Eighteen of them said that intensified Russia-Syrian airstrikes in Deir al-Zour and in Idlib had repeatedly displaced them until they finally decided they had no option but to risk their lives and flee to Turkey.

Those interviewed described 137 incidents, almost all between mid-December and early March, in which Turkish border guards intercepted them just after they had crossed the border with smugglers. Human Rights Watch spoke with another 35 Syrians stuck in Idlib who had not tried to escape for fear of being shot by border guards.

Nine people also described 10 incidents between September and early March in which Turkish border guards shot at them or others ahead of them as they tried to cross, killing 14 people, including 5 children, and injuring 18.

Civilians in Idlib have also been caught in the crossfire between Kurdish and Turkish forces during the offensive by Turkey in the Kurdish-held town of Afrin in Syria, north of Idlib, which began on January 20.

In November, the United Nations refugee agency said in its latest country guidance on Syria that “all parts of Syria are reported to have been affected, directly or indirectly, by one or multiple conflicts” and therefore maintained its long-standing call on all countries “not to forcibly return Syrians.”

Syrians who tried to enter Turkey said they were intercepted after they crossed the Orontes River or near the internally displaced persons camp in al-Dureyya. They said Turkish border guards deported them along with hundreds, and at times thousands, of other Syrians they had intercepted. They said the guards forced them to return to Syrian territory at an informal crossing point at Hatya or across a small dam on the Orontes River known as the Friendship Bridge that aid agencies have used.

Human Rights Watch obtained satellite images of both crossing points and of four security posts with large tents set up on basketball courts in the immediate border area where asylum seekers said they were held before being sent back to Syria.

The findings follow a February 3 Human Rights Watch report on Turkey’s border killings and summary pushbacks of asylum seekers between May and December 2017 and similar findings in November 2015 and May 2016.

In response to the February 3 report, a senior Turkish official repeated his government’s long-standing response to such reports, pointing out that Turkey has taken in millions of Syrian refugees. Human Rights Watch described its latest findings in a letter on March 15 to Turkey’s interior minister, requesting comment by March 21.

Turkey is hosting over 3.5 million Syrian refugees, according to the UN refugee agency. Turkey deserves credit and support for its generosity and is entitled to secure its border with Syria.

However, Turkey is also obliged to respect the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they face a real risk of persecution, torture, or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. This includes a prohibition on rejecting asylum seekers at borders that would expose them to such threats. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on the use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity.

Turkey insists that it respects the principle of nonrefoulement. “Syrians are accepted and taken under protection in Turkey and Syrians who have entered into Turkey somehow and demand protection are definitely not sent back and the reception and registration procedures are carried out,” the DGMM’s statement in response to this report said. “Syrians coming to Turkey are under no circumstances forced to go back to their own country; their registration is continuing and these foreigners can benefit from many rights and services in Turkey.”

As of December, Turkey had completed almost 800 kilometers of a planned 911-kilometer border barrier with Syria, which consists of a rocket-resistant concrete wall and steel fence. The satellite imagery Human Rights Watch obtained of the area where Syrians say they crossed with smugglers shows areas without a wall.

Turkey’s continued refusal since at least mid-2015 to allow Syrian asylum seekers to cross the border legally has been reinforced by a controversial EU-Turkey March 2016 migration agreement to curb refugee and migration flows to the European Union. The EU should instead be working with Turkey to keep its borders open to refugees, providing financial support for Turkey’s refugee efforts, and sharing responsibility by stepping up resettlement of refugees from Turkey, Human Rights Watch said.

“The EU should stop ignoring Turkey’s mass refugee deportations,” Simpson said. “The meeting in Bulgaria is a clear opportunity for the EU governments and institutions to change course and ramp up efforts to help Turkey protect Syrian refugees including through increased refugee resettlement.”

Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since many of those interviewed did not provide or do not have such specific information.

Regular Mass Pushbacks at the Turkish Border

Between February 14 and 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed the 21 Syrian asylum seekers who had tried multiple times to cross the border. Human Rights Watch interviewed them by cell phone and explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.

They described 137 incidents – 107 of them between January 1 and March 6 – in which Turkish border guards intercepted them at the border near the Syrian town of Darkush and held them at nearby security posts and then deported them back to Syria with hundreds, and at times thousands, of others.

A man from Deir al-Zour governorate who fled Syrian government attacks on his village in September 2017 said border guards intercepted him nine times in January and the first half of February in border areas close to the al-Dureyya displaced people’s camp in Syria.

Describing three incidents in February, he said:

Each time they insulted the men, calling them “Syrian traitors.” They forced some of them to collect firewood. Then they took all of us in military trucks to a basketball court at a security post near the Hatya border gate. There was also a big tent there. They put us all in the tent and kept us overnight. They didn’t give us any food or water or let us go to a proper toilet. There were so many in the tent, that we were spilling out into the open of the basketball court. We were hundreds of people. The next morning, they took us all back to the border in buses.

Three Syrians said they were deported with thousands of others. A man from al-Hamediyah who said Turkish border guards intercepted him 11 times between September and January said that he was usually deported with about 500 other people. However, he said that on one occasion, in January, the border guards gave the people they had intercepted trying to cross from Syria numbers and his was 3,890. He said he was one of the last to be put on buses and taken to the border.

Many people referred to two deportation points that they said were between 10 and 30 minutes’ drive from the security posts where border guards had held them: one was an informal border crossing at Hatya, and the other was a small dam on the Orontes River called “Friendship Bridge.” Human Rights Watch obtained satellite imagery of both crossing points and of four security posts in the immediate border area where asylum seekers said they crossed into Turkey.

A woman from Hama governorate who repeatedly tried to cross the border said she was deported six times during the first two weeks of February with groups she estimated to be between 50 and 600 other Syrians:

The second time, on around February 4, the border guards took us to a military post and put us in a big tent with 200 other people they had already caught. Four hours later, at about 8 a.m., they put us in large buses and drove us to the Friendship Bridge. There they told us to get out and walk across the river back into Syria.

The satellite imagery Human Rights Watch obtained confirms there are gaps in the wall the full length of the Orontes River, west of the Syrian town of Salkeen, and at various points between the southern tip of where the river meets the border and the Hatya border crossing.

Deportations from Antakya

Three Syrians said Turkish police had deported them or relatives from the town of Antakya, about 20 kilometers west of the Syrian border.

A man from Deir al-Zour governorate said:

I crossed the border at night with my wife and two daughters and about 20 other people in late December 2017 near the al-Dureyya [displacement] camp. The border guards didn’t find us. The smugglers took us to their house in Antakya, about two hours’ drive away. There were 20 other Syrians already there and they told us they had also crossed from Syria that night. Not long after that, Turkish police arrived at the house. They took all of us to a police station and held us there until the next morning. They took our fingerprints and photos. Then they took all of us in police vans to the border at Bab al-Hawa and sent us back to Syria.

A man from Hama governorate described what happened to his wife:

The Turks sent my wife back from Antakya twice. She told me everything that happened. The first time was a week ago [about February 10]. The smugglers drove her and about 10 other people from the border near the Orontes River up to Reyhanli and from there they drove to Antakya. They reached the edge of Antakya at about 6 a.m. Turkish police shot at the car’s wheels to force it to stop. They beat the driver and immediately put my wife and the others in a police van and drove them to the border at Bab al-Hawa. My wife crossed again four days later. The smugglers took her and about 10 others to a small house in a Turkish village near the border and then drove to a house in Antakya where there were already about 50 other Syrians who said they had arrived that night. Suddenly Turkish police arrived, at about 7 a.m. They wrote down their names and took photos. They put them in a big truck and took them to the Bab al-Hawa crossing. They held them there for the whole day and then sent them back to Syria.

Shootings by Border Guards

Nine Syrians interviewed described a total of 10 shooting incidents by Turkish border guards between September and March in which they said 14 people were killed and 18 injured.

In mid-February, a man from Deir al-Zour governorate said that in the previous five weeks he had tried four times to reach Turkey with his wife and five children. The first three times, he said, Turkish border guards deported them. The fourth time they turned back because Turkish border guards shot at their group as they approached the border:

A few hundred meters from the border near the al-Dureyya [displacement] camp the Turks suddenly started shooting at our group. They killed an 8-year-old girl and injured two men, one in a leg and the other in the stomach. I helped the man shot in the stomach turn back with the rest of us while the others carried the girl and helped the other man. Later the smugglers told us that a 13-year-old girl in another group trying to cross at the next time had also been killed during the shooting.

A man evacuated with his wife and baby from Aleppo in late 2016 said he unsuccessfully attempted to cross with them to Turkey three times near the al-Dureyya camp in September 2017 and January 2018 and was deported with hundreds of others the first two times. During the third attempt, in January, he said:

The border guards shot at us and injured my wife in her stomach and leg. She was pregnant and the baby died. They also injured two men and a 5-year-old boy, who was shot in the leg. We took my wife to a hospital in Syria near the border. Her heart stopped twice, but she lived. They couldn’t operate on her, so they sent her to Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa gate for surgery. They amputated her leg and removed her womb. They didn’t let me cross with her but a few days later a smuggler helped me and my daughter cross to Turkey.

Human Rights Watch also spoke with a doctor in a Syrian hospital near the Turkish border west of the town of Idlib who said that between August 1 and February 16, the hospital had received 66 people with gunshot-related injuries who said they had been shot while trying to cross the Turkish border.

Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis in Idlib governorate

According to the UN, about 2.65 million people are currently in Idlib governorate, over 1.75 million of whom have been displaced from elsewhere in Idlib or other parts of Syria, including almost 400,000 displaced since December. Civilians in Idlib have faced years of conflict. In September, Russian and Syrian forces began a fresh offensive in Idlib, three days after Russia, Iran, and Turkey had agreed to a ceasefire and “de-escalation” zone in the province and parts of Hama and western Aleppo. Human Rights Watch documented that attacks in September struck markets and populated residential areas and caused thousands of people to flee to displacement sites near the Turkish border.

Hostilities in Idlib halted on October 8 after Turkey deployed monitors there, but restarted in late December. In January, the Russian-Syrian military alliance carried out airstrikes to support Syrian ground troops. Some attacks involved prohibited weapons and targeted hospitals.

On January 21, Turkey started a military offensive in Kurdish-held Afrin , also putting displaced civilians at risk. Turkish and Kurdish forces have shelled each other on either side of Syria’s Atma displacement camp, on the Turkish border, which shelters 60,000 people.

Witnesses said that on February 6, during the fighting, shells hit the camp, killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring seven other civilians.

Human Rights Watch interviewed seven displaced Syrians about the incident. They all said it left their children terrified of the shelling and unable to sleep.

A father of seven children from Hama who lived close to where the shell landed on February 6 said:

I was there when it happened and rushed to help. I heard a young girl had been killed, but I only saw two who were injured. One had lost an arm and a leg and the other was blinded. I was so scared the same might happen to my children, we fled the camp and went to live in a field near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. But we couldn’t stay there all alone, without help, so we had to come back to the camp. We are all scared now, all the time.

A father of four children said the incident had so shaken his family, he had returned to his still conflict-riven home town of Kafr Zita in Hama governorate because all other displacement camps in Idlib were full. As his house had been destroyed, he said, he was living in a field on the edge of the town and struggling to survive: “There is still shelling here but if we die, it’s better to die at home.”

Human Rights Watch also spoke with five Syrians who had been repeatedly displaced in recent months within Idlib to escape the shifting front line and who, as of mid-February, were living as close as possible to the Turkish border in the hope of escaping the fighting.

The UN says that since December, the violence has displaced at least 385,000 people who have joined 2.65 million other civilians, including 1.35 million civilians displaced in the past few years.

In mid-February, Human Rights Watch interviewed two aid officials working in Idlib governorate. One summarized the dire humanitarian situation:

There is no more room anywhere for people displaced in the past few months. Displacement camps are completely full and we [humanitarians] do not have the resources to properly address basic needs of water, food, heating, health care, and education. Rent has skyrocketed so people end up living in the tens of thousands on the edge of towns and villages in fields in makeshift camps. There is simply no way the aid agencies can help all these people. At best they can give very limited help once in a while to some of them, and it is not done in an organized way. There is suffering everywhere, in every camp and in every village.

The 56 displaced Syrians in Idlib that Human Rights Watch interviewed, including 42 displaced by the recent violence, all described the extremely difficult conditions they had faced in Idlib in previous months. The newly displaced said they had heard that displacement camps were completely full and that they could not afford to pay the extremely high rents in the towns and villages in the area. They ended up living in waterlogged fields across Idlib governorate, often with other families in makeshift tents made from sacks and other material sewed together, because they could not afford to buy proper tents.

They said they struggled to find food and had to pay high fees for water, delivered by trucks. They either had seen no one from an aid agency, or those who had, said they were unable to help or had promised help but hadn’t returned.

Turkish authorities have allowed Turkish and international aid groups based in Turkey to cross into Syria and join Syrian aid groups to distribute tents and other assistance to Syrians in camps in border areas. Human Rights Watch said that allowing much-needed cross-border aid is important, but does not absolve Turkey of its obligation to allow Syrian civilians fleeing fighting to seek protection in Turkey.

EU Silence

Human Rights Watch has documented that, since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards enforcing the country’s March 2015 border closure have deported Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April and May 2016, Human Rights Watch documented Turkish border guards shooting and beating Syrian asylum seekers trying to cross to Turkey, resulting in deaths and serious injuries, and sending those who managed to cross back to Syria. In February 2018, Human Rights Watch reported on further killings, injuries and pushbacks that happened in the second half of 2017.

On May 20, 2016, Human Rights Watch called on UN member states and UN agencies attending the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul to press the Turkish authorities to reopen Turkey’s border to Syrian asylum seekers. But neither the European Commission nor any European Union member state – or any other country – has publicly pressed Turkey to do so, while UN agencies have also remained publicly silent.

The world’s – and in particular the EU’s – silence over Turkey’s breach of the cornerstone of international refugee law condones Turkey’s border abuses.

The EU’s failure to take in more Syrian asylum seekers and refugees also contributes to the pressure on Turkey. The EU should swiftly fulfill its own commitments to relocate Syrian and other asylum seekers from Greece and, together with other countries, it should also expand safe and legal channels for people to reach safety from Turkey, including through increased refugee resettlement, humanitarian admissions, humanitarian and other visas, and facilitated family reunification."

IOM staff speak to survivors from a fishing boat that capsized in stormy weather in waters between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Photo: UN Migration Agency (IOM) 2017

Cox’s Bazar – Tragedy struck more Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar last night. At least 13 people, mostly children, drowned when the fishing boat carrying them to safety in Bangladesh capsized in stormy weather.

The Bangladesh coast guard found 13 bodies, including seven boys between the ages of 3-10 years, and four girls aged 2-3 years. The bodies of a 70-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman were also recovered from the waves.

There were approximately 60 refugees aboard the 20-metre, wooden fishing vessel when it left Myanmar under cover of darkness, hoping avoid patrols on both sides of the border, survivors told UN Migration Agency staff at the scene.

IOM staff spoke to survivors, among them a traumatized 8-year-old boy. Transfixed with shock, Arafat, said his entire family was lost in the accident. They included his father Kamal Hossain, 25 years; mother Shahara Khatun, 20 years; sister Jannat Ara, 10 years; and younger brother Ziad, who was 7 years of age.

“Where will I go now,” he cried, as a relative who had travelled from Cox’s Bazaar on hearing the news of the tragedy stood by him.

Two other children sitting next to Arafat also lost their entire families last night.

Rumana, a 7-year-old girl, told IOM her mother Ayesha (35), two sisters Minara (8) and Nur Fatima (10) as well as her brother Nur Hashim (7) all drowned. Her father had died shortly after she was born. Rumana, still visibly in shock as she recounted the names and ages of her family, ended with: “Everyone in my family died.”

Jobayer, an 8-year-old boy lost his entire family. His mother Moriom Khatun (30) father Habibullah (40), brother Kefayet Ullah (10) and two sisters Fatema (9) and Taiyaba (7) where amongst those who did not make it last night.

Another survivor, Hassan (22) lost all nine members of his family, who were also on the boat. His mother Gulzar, 60 years old; father Jahid Hossain, 55; sister Senoara, 25; her husband Abdus Subhan, 35; and their three children aged 4, 3 and 18 months all drowned, along with a baby niece and a nephew.

Syed Hoson, 25, lost his wife Khaleda Begum, 22 and three boys Ibrahin, 7, Mohammad Hoson, 5, and Sobayer, 3 months-old.

The funeral of seven of those who drowned took place earlier today. The service attended by the IOM filed staff on the scene, was conducted near where they drowned.

The fleeing Rohingya had paid Bangladeshi fisherman the equivalent of USD 30 a head for what should have been a short sea journey, survivors said.

Their boat was headed for Shahporir Dwip, an island at the southern tip of Bangladesh, about 78 kilometres south of Cox’s Bazar, when it foundered at Golar Para Char when the fisherman at the helm lost control and ran aground.

The overloaded boat, which would normally carry 20 people, had approximately 60 on board, and was swamped by high waves and winds in a sudden monsoon storm.

It sailed from Dongkhalir Char in Buthidaung Township, North Rakhine State, at around 6.00 pm local time. At around 9 pm the Bangladesh coast guard and border police were alerted and launched a rescue mission.

Like many of the most recent arrivals in Bangladesh, the refugees caught up in last night’s tragedy came from villages well inside Myanmar. They told IOM staff that they walked for eleven days before reaching the coast.

“Thousands of Rohingya have taken shelter at Dongkhalir Char. Some are living in the open under the sun, others managed to get polythene, tarpaulin or are using pieces of cloth to make temporary shelters for themselves. People there are waiting for boats to come from Bangladesh to help them cross,"" Hassan told IOM.

Their tragedy follows on another mass drowning on September 28, when another fishing boat carrying refugees capsized near the same spot. In that incident 23 people were drowned and 17 survived.

As of 7th October, 519,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Bangladesh, including 467,800 identified by IOM assessments in the Cox’s Bazar area.

Tunis – Eight migrants have died in the wake of a collision between a Tunisian navy vessel and a boat reportedly carrying 87 migrants on Sunday, 8 October. A further 38 migrants have been rescued and approximately 41 are still missing.

The tragic incident happened in the early hours of Sunday about 54 kilometers off Kerkennah Island, Tunisia. The migrants’ boat is believed to have left from the Tunisian port of Sfax and was headed towards Italy.

The 38 survivors, all Tunisian nationals, were rescued from the sea by the Tunisian navy on board the vessel involved in the Collison. They were brought back to Sfax and released shortly after. Tunisian authorities announced yesterday (10/10) that they are undertaking a rigorous investigation into the circumstances of the incident.

IOM, the UN Migration Agency is following up on the status of the missing migrants. “We are saddened with this tragedy that is affecting so many migrants and their families” said Lorena Lando, IOM Tunisia Chief of Mission. “IOM is committed to support and advocate for safe and dignified migration. We are concerned about the increasing events of irregular migration from Tunisian coasts and we work closely with all stakeholders to develop long-term solutions,” added Lando.

“The number of Tunisian migrants who reached Italy by sea has increased,” said Federico Soda, Director of IOM’s Coordination Office for the Mediterranean, commenting the recent trends. “From January to August 2017, 1357 Tunisians have reached the Italian coast, while IOM estimates that over 1400 have arrived during the month of September 2017 alone. While the increase of September it is quite unusual, numbers per se are quite low compared to the arrivals registered in Italy in 2017,” said Soda.

AN unidentified border jumper died when he was attacked by a hippo on a foot path leading to the Limpopo River.

The incident occurred some 500m on the eastern side of the border post on Tuesday.

It is reported that the man believed to be between 30 and 40 years met his fate near the Beitbridge town council sewer ponds. His body was discovered by a council worker late on Tuesday suspended from the sewer ponds’ fence. It is suspected that he died while fleeing from the marauding animal.

The incident comes a few months after three people were attacked and killed by a hippo under the New Limpopo River bridge while attempting to skip the border to South Africa. Two other minors aged seven and nine years were seriously injured in the attack and were taken to Musina Government Hospital.

In the latest case, Matabeleland South police spokesperson, Inspector Philisani Ndebele, said the matter was still under investigation. “We are treating the matter as sudden death since indications are that he was attacked and killed by wild animals,” he said.

“The area is a common spot where wild animals including hippopotamuses are found. As police we want to encourage people to always follow legal channels when travelling to any country to avoid unnecessary loss of lives due to attacks by wild animals or criminals.”The man’s body, he said, was taken to Beitbridge District Hospital for a post-mortem.

He said on the same day they also received a report of a 44-year-old woman who collapsed and died at Dulivhadzimo bus terminus."

Caribbean,2017-10-15,,37.0,37,13.0,,,,Haiti,Caribbean,Drowning,Haiti,,"Near La Tortue Island, Haiti",http://bit.ly/2yknQ2D,5,"AFP

Port-au-Prince: About 40 people are missing after a migrant vessel sunk the northern coast of Haiti, the civil emergency authorities have said.



Seven people were rescued Sunday by search teams scouring the seas off the island of La Tortue, Haiti's civil emergency agency said.



The vessel sank after leaving La Tortue earlier in the day for Providenciales island in the northern Turks and Caicos archipelago, 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the north.



According to the survivors, three of whom were hospitalized on their return to Haiti, the vessel was carrying 50 people when it sank.



In a country where more than 60 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day, there are frequent attempts to reach the Bahamas or Turks and Caicos illegally.



Over the past five years, thousands of young Haitians have migrated to Chile or Brazil, countries where visas are more easily obtained.



Although Haitians historically have gone to the United States, and to Florida in particular, the flow of migrants has shifted to Canada and other neighboring countries.



Since a devastating earthquake in 2010, about 60,000 Haitians have found temporary protected status in the United States.



But US President Donald Trump's administration has said that status will expire at the close of 2017."

Europe,2017-10-16,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Algeria,Northern Africa,Vehicle accident / death linked to hazardous transport,Spain,,"N-II motorway, near La Jonquera, Girona, Spain, at the border with France",http://bit.ly/2zSM4lu,3,"Va intentar trobar una millor vida a Europa i en voler creuar la frontera d'Espanya a França posant en perill la seva vida va acabar mort. Aquesta és la història del jove que va perdre la vida el 16 d'octubre a la Jonquera després de ser atropellat per un tràiler a la Nacional II.

La víctima era un noi de 26 anys, nacut a Algèria i que havia arribat a Espanya en pastera. No se sap com va arribar a la Jonquera des d'Almeria després de fer 960 quilòmetres. El que és cert és que la frontera va ser el seu destí final.

Va morir atropellat per un camió. Un fet que com han pogut confirmar els Mossos d'Esquadra de l'Àrea Regional de Trànsit (ART) de Girona va ser fruit d'un accident. El xofer del tràiler no ha acabat imputat per cap delicte i l'atestat està a mans del jutge per si aquest considera que el camioner estranger ha de prestar declaració pels fets davant de la policia.

Cal recordar que quan van ócorrer els fets el conductor del vehicle no va poder ésser identificat ja que aquest va marxar del lloc. A partir d'aquí, els Mossos d'Esquadra van començar una investigació que ha donat els seus fruits.

D'entrada han conclòs que el xofer no va protagonitzar una fugida sinó que tot va ser un cúmul de circumstàncies que van acabar en un malaurat accident.

Els agents del Grup de Recerca i Documentació (GRD) de Trànsit dels Mossos van fer-se càrrec d'aquest cas i, un cop obtingudes les imatges de les càmeres de vigilància de la zona, van poder identificar el vehicle i el conductor que va cometre l'atropellament. Era un xofer polonès.

L'accident mortal va ócorrer el dia 16 cap a quarts d'onze de la nit. Uns camioners que estaven a l'aparcament d'importacions de la duana de la Jonquera van alertar que hi havia un jove inconsicent a terra. El noi no va superar les lesions tot i ser evacuat al CAP de la Jonquera i va acabar morint.

Aquesta era d'entrada l'única informació que tenia la policia el dia dels fets. Però un cop van identificar el vehicle, el conductor i van visionar les imatges de videovigilància de les càmeres de la zona van descobrir com s'havien produït els fets.

En patera a Almeria

El jove anava en el camió que va atropellar-lo. Era un polissó, que havia pujat al para-xocs davanter del vehicle i s'hi va posar horitzontalment. La mala sort va voler que encara no havia fet un quilòmetre el vehicle, en va caure sobtadament i llavors, es va produir el fatal accident: el vehicle pesant li va passar pel damunt.

El jove va poder ésser identificat un cop fetes gestions policials i l'autòpsia. Finalment, els Mossos van descobrir la vivència d'aquest noi de 26 anys.

El jove era procedent d'Algèria i havia estat rescatat feia diversos dies quan havia arribat en pastera a la costa d'Almeria. Des del rescat comptava amb una ordre d'expulsió per part de la Policia Nacional. Llavors, no se sap com, va aparèixer i morir a la Jonquera, intentant entrar a França."

In this week’s Inside with Chris Cuomo, he travels to Webb County, Texas, where he gets a first-hand look at the tragic deaths of illegal aliens who die while attempting to enter the U.S. The show airs on CNN’s sister network, HLN at 9 p.m. EDT.

During “The Talking Dead,” Cuomo travels along the border with Webb County Medical Examiner, Dr. Corinne Stern. The Laredo, Texas, medical examiner is tasked with identifying the remains of those left behind by ruthless cartel-connected human smugglers where they die from dehydration and heat stroke on an all-too-frequent basis.

Referring to Border Patrol agents whose job it is to track down these illegal immigrants, Cuomo says, “Even with all the helicopters, sensors, and manpower, by the time they find the migrants in this inhospitable terrain — it is often too late.”

Cuomo’s video trailer provides an extremely graphic look at what Texas law enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents face on an all too often basis as the dead migrants are found in varying degrees of decomposition.

Cuomo said that less than one-third of the Laredo Sector’s 171 miles of the U.S. border with Mexico is monitored by sensors and cameras. The rest, as Breitbart Texas Editor-in-Chief Brandon Darby has been reporting for years, is wide open.

“It’s very rough terrain,” Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta tells Cuomo. “Once you get underneath (the brush), you have this canopy over you, where you have no clue where you are at. Unless you actually know those trails, you’re not going to know which way is north, which way is up, or which way is down.”

Dr. Stern processes the deceased migrants she refers to a “patients” rather than bodies. In addition to the deceased migrants found in Brooks County, Stern also provides services to other smaller counties from Brooks County in the east, to Del Rio in the west.

Many of those deceased migrants are found in Brooks County where Breitbart Texas has been reporting on their deaths since 2014.

“We have had 43 deaths in our county this year,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas on Tuesday. “While the rate of deaths is down this year, the total number of deaths since 2009 now stands at 573.”

Martinez attributes the lower death rate this year to the increased Border Patrol activity in the Rio Grande Valley Sector since President Donald Trump took office in January.

“It all has to do with resources,” the sheriff said. “It’s been a big help.” A big help for indeed for Texas’ poorest county whose taxpayers must foot the bill for Dr. Stern’s autopsy and identification costs.

“Human smugglers in our area have moved further west this year,” Martinex explained. “This means the migrants have much further to walk before they can be picked up on highway 285 near the Brooks/Jim Hogg county line.”

In an interview with Breitbart Texas on Tuesday, Dr. Stern says her office is on pace to exceed the number of deaths of migrants recorded last year. “We have seen 109 migrant deaths as of today,” she stated. “In addition to the 43 from Brooks County, 42 were found here in Webb County. Starr County had 10, Dimmit had 5, and the remainder came from Jim Hogg, Zapata, Maverick, Kenedy, and Val Verde counties.”

In 2016, Stern said she processed the remains of 124 deceased migrants.

“We believe the number of actual deaths is actually higher than this,” Stern explained. “Many of the justices of the peace do not send the remains to us if they can identify them. Some will use identification found in the pockets of the deceased as identification. Unfortunately, this can be very misleading.”

Dr. Stern discusses the time it takes to identify the remains of the migrants, saying it often takes up to five months to get DNA results. She tries to use other methods to find their identities more quickly.

Cuomo walks outside Stern’s office where the doctor shows him two large coolers where the remains of 52 migrants are being stored until she receives DNA results from the FBI. Sheriff Martinez says many of those came from Brooks County.

Once it is determined that an immigrant’s remains will not be able to be identified, the body is transported to local cemeteries where they are buried in graves marked “John Doe” or “Jane Doe.” After time passes most of those grave markers disappear, leaving no trace of the unidentified migrant.

“We’re talking about hundreds of John Does and Jane Does,” Laredo cemetery supervisor David Paredes tells Cuomo. “Even little children that never get identified.”

Stern says the migrants make up about 25 percent of the deaths that she processed in Webb County. “But it takes up about 40 percent of my time,” she explained.

Cuomo and Dr. Stern did not talk about the cost born by taxpayers for these deaths. Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart Texas in earlier interviews his cost approaches $2,500 per deceased migrant.

Cuomo did ask her what she thinks of those who complain about the cost of burying “those who don’t belong here.”

Stern responded, “I don’t practice politics, I practice medicine.”

In her interview with Breitbart Texas, she expressed that she is happy to see the federal government increasing prosecution of the human smugglers who cause these deaths. “They’re really starting to crack down on the smugglers,” Stern said. “We are seeing more and more prosecutions.”

Sheriff Martinez expressed his frustration with the mounting death toll his county is experiencing. “As long as these ruthless human smugglers continue to make money marching their ‘cargo’ through South Texas, these deaths will continue,” the sheriff said. “We will keep doing our best to save as many of them as we can.”

“The Talking Dead” episode of Inside with Chris Cuomo will air Friday, October 27, at 9 p.m. EDT on CNN’s sister network, HLN."

South-eastern Asia,2017-10-30,2.0,1.0,3,,,,1.0,Myanmar,Southern Asia,Drowning,Bangladesh,,"Off the coast of Sabrang Union, Teknaf, Bangladesh",http://bit.ly/2h2Ol6c,4,"Four Die, Survivors in Critical Condition as Second Boat Carrying Rohingya Refugees Capsizes in Two Days

Cox’s Bazar – Around 2.00 am two nights ago (30/10), approximately 40 Rohingya refugees left Gorgondia, Myanmar, for Bangladesh on a small fishing boat. Early yesterday morning (31/10) around 8.00 am, the boat capsized off Baillakhali Sea Point in Jaliapalong Union, Ukhiya sub-district. It had just crossed the Bangladesh border and was trying to reach Shamlapur in Teknaf sub-district. They were 10 kilometres away from their destination.

Four refugees died in the tragedy, while 36 people were rescued by the local community – local authorities, members of local Union Parishad, fire service, police and local people, including fishermen. The remains of four people were recovered – one woman and three children, including Juhora Begum, a 60-year-old woman, Monira, a four-and-a-half-year-old girl, Anamul Hasan, a 6-year-old boy, and another ten-year-old boy. The boy’s body was buried on the beach by people living nearby.

IOM, the UN Migration Agency, learned of the incident immediately and deployed a mobile medical team of a doctor and a nurse with two ambulances. The team checked all the survivors. Five were referred to Cox’s Bazar General Hospital, two to the Ukhiya Upazila Health Complex, four to the MOAS Hospital in Shamlapur, and two to the IOM Centre at the Baharchara Family Welfare Clinic.

IOM spoke to two of the survivors at the government-run Upazila Health Complex, which is supported by IOM.

""There were 40 people on the boat – 19 women and seven men, the rest were children. The weather deteriorated early in the morning and the boat capsized. We did not have enough money to make the journey on foot. So, with relatives living abroad, we arranged for a boat to take us across the border [into Bangladesh]. I have lost my children and my mother-in-law,” said a woman, whose one-year-old son is in critical condition and having difficulty breathing.

""We were drowning in the water, even my child. Under the water, I could not hold my son. When we floated to the surface, I found him. I saw a jerry can and used it to float to the shore. Because I had the jerry can, I was able to get my son and myself to the shore…. When we were rescued, the doctors found that my baby was near death and an ambulance took us to this hospital,” she added. Her husband also survived, but at the time of the interview was arranging the burial of one of their other children, who survived the crossing, but died on arrival at the IOM-supported clinic at Shamlapur. ""We came here to save our lives but I lost my children,"" she said.

Gulbahar, a woman in her late twenties, was also in poor condition, having swallowed sea water. “When the boat came close to Bangladesh coast, two or three people jumped off when they saw land. The boat then lost balance in the stormy weather and capsized. As soon as that happened, I was in the water and didn’t know where my children were. A man grabbed my hair and pulled me up from the sea and suddenly I could breath again. Everyone in the boat was carrying all the valuables they owned – they were all lost,"" she said, still gasping for breath.

But her whole family – her husband and three children – survived. ""We were freezing. Some people gave us blankets and then the doctors arrived to help,” she said. Two of her children are now with her in the Ukhiya Upazila Health Complex and her husband is with the other child in another hospital.

IOM doctor Raisul Islam, who was the IOM doctor on the scene, said that scene on the beach was deeply distressing. “They were sitting on the beach under a plastic sheet. The dead body of a child was laid out nearby. It was freezing cold and people were coughing. I checked everyone to see who was most urgently in need of medical care and identified two patients – a child and a woman – who were in critical condition. I travelled here with them in one of the ambulances.”

“The other ambulance brought other survivors in need of treatment to other health facilities, including the IOM-supported clinic in Shamlapur. Some families were split up and brought to different facilities based on their condition. Once the patients are stable, we will be able to reunite the families – hopefully, this afternoon.”

This tragedy came a day after a boat carrying approximately 30 Rohingya refugees had capsized (30/10) at Sabrang Union, Teknaf sub-district. Two of the refugees died and one is still missing. People from the vicinity rescued some of the people on board, while others swam to shore. Nine of the survivors were taken to hospital for treatment.

It was one of the most intense days of rescues recorded in the area in recent months and follows a sharp fall-off in the number of migrants reaching Italy.

A Coastguard spokesman said the seven bodies were picked up by a boat under the command of a European Union naval force operating in the Mediterranean. He had no further information about who they were or how they had died.

About 900 migrants were rescued in eight different missions, the spokesman said, adding that he expected they would be brought to Italy later in the week.

Migrant arrivals in Italy fell 30 percent in the first eight months of the year, the Interior Ministry said this week, thanks mainly to a sharp decline since July when Italy struck a deal with Libya to block would-be asylum seekers from setting sail.

As part of the deal, the Libyan coastguard has played a much more active role in preventing crossings. Earlier this week, it intercepted 299 migrants from sub-Saharan African countries on two rubber boats east of Tripoli, officials said.

Libya's western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, many of them fleeing conflict or poverty.

The Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that between January and October, 111,397 migrants had reached Italy by boat against 159,427 in the same period in 2016. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says that so far this year at least 2,630 people have died at sea trying to cross to Italy.

Mediterranean,2017-11-06,6.0,28.0,34,106.0,,1.0,1.0,Unknown,Sub-Saharan Africa (P),Drowning,Libya,Central Mediterranean,"30 nautical miles north of Tripoli, Libya",http://bit.ly/2zBoHgB,4,"The violent and reckless behavior of Libyan Coast Guards has caused at least five deaths on the Central Mediterranean Sea this morning, as the crew of the Sea-Watch 3 was called to their first rescue mission by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center. A helicopter of the Italian Navy had to intervene to prevent more fatalities. 58 people are now safe aboard the Sea-Watch 3, despite all efforts, our medical team was not able to revive an infant in our clinic. The Libyan Coast Guards forced a few of the passengers on their vessel and took them back in direction Libya. By interfering in the rescue operation, the Libyans clearly violated international law: The incident took place at 30 nm off the coast, in international waters far outside of Libyan territorial waters.



At approx. 7 am, the crew aboard Sea-Watch 3 received a call of Rome MRCC. North of Tripoli a sinking inflatable boat in international waters had sent a distress call. The Sea-Watch 3 crew arrived on location at about the same time as a Libyan Coast Guard patrol boat and started boarding of people in distress. The Libyan Coast Guard approached the boat as well and took over people from aboard the boat, however beating and threatening them. Onboard panic started and a numerous refugees fell overboard. The Libyan ship took off with inappropriate speed while people were still latching onto the side, being dragged by their vessel. After Sea-Watch had already repeadtedly alarmed the Libyans about their life-threatening practice, an Italian Navy helicopter had to intervene, briefly stopping the Libyan ship, to prevent further deadly maneuvering. At least 5 people were killed in the boat’s sinking, among them a child whom the medical crew onboard Sea-Watch 3 was not able to reanimate.

“Probably, nobody would have had to die today if only we had the possibility to operate reasonably in a calm environment. Instead of coordinating the rescue operation with the vessels present such as a ship of the French Navy, the Libyans tried to take as many people as possible back to Libya – and accepted the loss of several lives”, says head of mission Johannes Bayer. “These deaths have to be blamed on the Libyan Coast Guards who have obstructed a safe rescue with their brutal behavior. The responsability is on the side of the European Union, however, who trains and finances these militias. They act in the EU’s will. The European governments finally have to draw conclusions from this incident and stop the collaboration with the Libyan Coast Guards. The EU has to stop to rate migration control higher than human rights!”

Libyan Coast Guards have clearly breached international law by bringing an unknown number of people onboard their vessel, probably with the goal to take them back to Libya. “We were at high seas, outside of libyan territorial waters, about 30 nm north of Tripoli – even outside of the consecutive zone. There, the Libyans have no sovereign rights whatsoever”, says Sea-Watch captain Pia Klemp.

Almost a year ago, October 21 2016, in a similar disastrous event many people died when, during a rescue operation of Sea-Watch 2, the so-called Libyan Coast Guard had tried to displace refugees back to Libya from international waters.

All 58 survivors are now safe aboard the Sea-Watch 3.

Health officials said the other four migrants and the Pakistani driver of the car were injured in the accident late Tuesday near the town of Kavala, east of Thessaloniki.

Kavala hospital director Anastassios Karassavoglou told The Associated Press that one man was in intensive care with multiple bone fractures, while the other four were in relatively good condition.

Police said the accident occurred when the driver ignored police orders to stop on a highway, turned onto a smaller road and lost control of the vehicle. One of those in the trunk died.

The names and nationalities of the migrants were not immediately known.

The 35-year-old driver faces multiple manslaughter and human trafficking charges.

The car was carrying the migrants west from the Turkish border, which they had crossed illegally.

In a similar incident late Tuesday in the same area, police arrested a 19-year-old Pakistani who was allegedly driving a car with another seven people on board from the Turkish border area to Thessaloniki.

Police said the suspect drove through a police highway checkpoint and was eventually stopped on a secondary road. The car was carrying five Pakistani migrants, an Afghan and an alleged accomplice of the driver who managed to escape. The migrants had allegedly paid 2,100 euros ($2,500) each to be taken to Thessaloniki.

Despite a series of Balkan border closures and a deal between the European Union and Turkey in early 2016 to restrict the unchecked flow of migrants through Greece to Europe’s prosperous heartland, thousands still cross from Turkey to the Greek islands in smuggling boats.

Nearly 16,000 are stuck on Greece’s eastern Aegean Sea islands in camps that human rights groups have repeatedly criticized as overcrowded and lacking in proper housing facilities."

A man who was suspected of being an undocumented immigrant was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in southern Arizona on Wednesday morning, officials said.

When the minibus came across with a regular gendarmerie roadblock in Altınözü district, the driver did not follow orders to stop and tried to escape.

Shortly after, the minibus collided with a truck coming from opposite direction, turning into a heap of junk after as it went under the truck and dragged for meters.

Ten migrants immediately died in the scene, whereas eight others, including the driver, were badly injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.

Mediterranean,2017-12-03,,3.0,3,18.0,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Drowning,Morocco,Western Mediterranean,"Off the coast of Tangiers, Morocco",http://bit.ly/2AHkGrX,4,"Watch The Med Alarm Phone Investigations – 3rd of December 2017 Case name: 2017_12_03-WM191 Situation: 21 travellers from Morocco, 3 people missing Status of WTM Investigation: Not concluded Place of Incident: Western Mediterranean

Summary of the Case:

On Sunday the 3rd of December, at 08:03am, we got alerted by a contact person to a boat in distress that had left from a beach south of Tangier towards Spain at 5am, carrying 21 persons. We called the boat at 08:13am and heard the voices of the travellers as well as the engine of the boat, but they could not hear us. We tried to gather more information about the exact place of departure in order to localize the boat. At 09:10am we managed to establish communication with the boat. Their engine wasn’t working anymore and they reported that people had fallen into the water. At 09:15am we alerted the Spanish rescue authority Salvamento Maritimo (SM). At 09:35am we called the boat again. They reported that only three persons were left on board out of the initial 21 travellers and that the others were in the water. At 09:45am we informed SM whose search operation we could observe on the live map Vesselfinder.

Only at 10:18am did we manage to re-establish contact to the travellers. The situation was getting more dangerous due to rising waves and water that entered the boat. We tried to localize them with descriptions of the commercial cargo ships they saw. We were in contact several times and always passed on the information we were given to SM. At 10:50am we managed to get a clear indication of their position: They saw a name of a cargo ship whose position we checked with Vesselfinder. They were between the cargo ship and the Moroccan coast.

At 10:52am we called SM to pass the news, and wrote an email with all information to the relevant authorities. At 11:19 we observed on Vesselfinder that the rescue asset of Salvamento Maritimo was leaving the area back towards the harbour of Tarifa. At 11:22am we called SM to investigate. They emphasized that the boat in distress was in Moroccan waters and therefore the case would not be their responsibility. They said that they had informed the Moroccan authorities. At 11:35am we called the Moroccan Rescue Coordination Center MRCC Rabat. They confirmed to have received the information from SM and said they would start a rescue operation.

We could not establish contact to the boat anymore and called MRCC Rabat again at 12:00, but they hadn’t found the boat yet. Also Salvamento didn’t have news.

At 12:42pm we reached the boat again. One person had lost consciousness, and the situation was getting critical. We could not find further indication of their position.

At 12:45pm we called MRCC Rabat again, but they did not have news. We therefore wrote another email to the Spanish and Moroccan authorities to request assistance from Spain in the search operation.

At 2:33pm the contact person informed us that the 18 people who were missing had survived and were with the Moroccan authorities. This information was confirmed at 4:30pm by SM.

We could not reach the travellers anymore. During the following days we were continuously calling SM and MRCC Rabat to put pressure on them to continue the search, and to find out if there were any new developments in the case. MRCC Rabat kept confirming that they were still searching for the boat, whilst SM claimed to have no responsibility in the case, as the boat had been in Moroccan waters. On the 6th of December at 5.47pm we chose to conclude that the three people had gone missing, as MRCC Rabat informed us that they were now mainly looking for other boats in the area. This catastrophe could probably have been avoided, if SM had chosen to act in the interest of saving lives at the point where we had a clear indication of the whereabouts of the boat. Instead they acted in the interest of fortress Europe, whose policy it is to push back the task of saving lives to their neighbouring states, without assuming any responsibility for the outcome."

“Crossing the border illegally poses multiple hazards,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez. “Sadly another human life was lost yesterday while attempting to illegally enter the United States.”

In the morning hours of Dec. 7, Eagle Pass Station agents were relayed a distress call, originating from the local 911 system, from a group of three subjects lost on a remote ranch. The caller stated they had been separated from a larger group of migrants and that one subject was suffering in the extreme cold.

When agents located the three individuals one had already passed away. The Mexican Consulate was notified and Maverick County Sheriff’s Office responded to the area to take custody of the body.

At the scene, agents also determined that more subjects were potentially lost in the surrounding area. After a few hours of searching, agents from the Eagle Pass Station, Eagle Pass South Station, Uvalde Station, and the Del Rio Sector Border Patrol Special Operations Detachment located 14 other undocumented immigrants crossing though the ranch. With frigid temperatures, and the first substantial snowfall in Eagle Pass in for than 30 years, agents potentially saved the subjects’ lives.

The group was transported to the Fort Duncan Regional Medical Center for treatment, stemming from exposure to the cold. Upon medical release, they will be transported to the Eagle Pass South Border Patrol Station for processing as per CBP guidelines.

For fiscal year 2017, which ended on Sept. 30, Del Rio Sector documented 17 border deaths. The Del Rio Border Patrol Sector is part of the Joint Task Force-West South Texas Corridor, which leverages federal, state and local resources to combat transnational criminal organizations.

Later that day, Kingsville agents responded to a call for assistance from a ranch in Norias, Texas. A ranch hand had located a distressed individual on the property. Responding agents found a male subject who appeared to be suffering from hypothermia due to the cold rain and air temperature. He was disoriented, unable to speak, shaking and floating in and out of consciousness. Agents valiantly performed CPR on two occasions to successfully resuscitate the man. Before Emergency Medical Services arrived to transport the subject to a hospital, he again lost consciousness, breath and a pulse. After hours of attempting to revive the subject, doctors pronounced him deceased. No identification was discovered on the man and where he was originally located. The unknown decedent remains at a local morgue.

Later that day, Kingsville agents responded to a call for assistance from a ranch in Norias, Texas. A ranch hand had located a distressed individual on the property. Responding agents found a male subject who appeared to be suffering from hypothermia due to the cold rain and air temperature. He was disoriented, unable to speak, shaking and floating in and out of consciousness. Agents valiantly performed CPR on two occasions to successfully resuscitate the man. Before Emergency Medical Services arrived to transport the subject to a hospital, he again lost consciousness, breath and a pulse. After hours of attempting to revive the subject, doctors pronounced him deceased. No identification was discovered on the man and where he was originally located. The unknown decedent remains at a local morgue.

CBP makes cold and snowy rescue.

Upon landing at the scene, AIA Derek Richardson – an Advanced Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with the elite Air and Marine Emergency Medical Services (AMEMS) program – immediately began assessing and triaging the individuals. One individual was deceased on arrival. The remaining 14 individuals were all in various states of distress and hypothermia.

After assessing vital signs on all of the individuals, AIA Richardson began rendering medical care and called for additional assistance from the United States Border Patrol (USBP) - Big Bend Sector EMT program. AIA Richardson continued prolonged field care for the individuals, and once additional EMTs arrived, developed a casualty evacuation plan to move people down from the top of the mountain where they were located. Less critical patients were moved by USBP agents in their vehicles, while critical patients were moved by AIA Richardson in the Eurocopter AS350 helicopter he was piloting.

After moving five individuals down the mountain via helicopter and nine others down via USBP vehicle, AIA Richardson turned over patient care to local EMTs who had arrived near the evacuation site in ambulances. The ambulances transported the injured to Big Bend Regional Medical Center (BBRMC) in Alpine for further evaluation and treatment.

One of the more critical patients went into cardiac arrest during transport and had to be flown from BBRMC to a trauma center for more advanced care. All individuals were determined to be illegal aliens from Guatemala who had been walking through the desert for approximately a week. The Big Bend area fell under an unexpected winter storm warning on Wednesday.

“While the loss of even one life is tragic, the heroic efforts of our expertly trained agents responding to this chaotic, mass-casualty event clearly saved 14 lives from certain death,” said Supervisory Air Interdiction Agent and AMEMS Program Manager Jeff Birks. “Their immediate and enduring response, under the harshest of conditions, reflects great credit upon themselves and our agency.”

AIA Richardson was on patrol with USBP Agent Jesus Flores when they located the group’s trail in the snow on the side of mountain. After following the trail some distance, they were able to guide USBP – Marfa Station agents to the location of the individuals. AIA Richardson was able to land near the group and render immediate medical aid."

Eight of the ten deceased immigrants were found near Falfurrias, Texas. The remaining two were discovered in Hidalgo and Norias, Texas.

On Thursday, December 14, Falfurrias agents working patrol operations on local ranchlands located a deceased subject in the brush. Agents contacted the Brooks County Sheriff’s Office and the local Justice of the Peace to notify them of the discovery. The body was transported to the medical examiner’s office.

Days earlier, Falfurrias agents responded to the discovery of two deceased subjects on a local ranch. During the recovery, an Air Interdiction agent observed a third deceased subject. Brooks County Sheriff’s Office and the local Justice of the Peace arrived and pronounced the three subjects deceased. All three bodies were transported to a local funeral home.

The additional deceased subjects found were as follows:

Saturday, December 9th – Falfurrias, Texas – two deceased subjects discovered near Highway 281 north of the checkpoint.

Friday, December 8th – Hidalgo, Texas – unresponsive female discovered by Air and Marine helicopter, pronounced deceased upon arrival to hospital.

Thursday, December 7th – Falfurrias, Texas – two deceased subjects discovered by ranchers.

Thursday, December 7th – Norias, Texas – distressed subject located who later lost consciousness while receiving medical attention. Subject pronounced deceased at hospital.

""Illegal immigrants are victimized and lied to by smugglers who lead them through treacherous terrain and expose them to extreme conditions,” said Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. “Those unable to keep up are left behind; some are rescued by Border Patrol agents but, tragically, we don’t find others until it is too late.”

RGV Sector urges immigrants not to jeopardize their lives by illegally entering the United States or by attempting to circumvent a checkpoint. The public is encouraged to take a stand against crime in our communities and to help save lives by reporting suspicious activity at 800-863-9382.

He was pulled back to the safety of the boat but became ill after being exposed to frigid temperatures.

Gendarmerie forces intercepting the group discovered the shivering man and brought him to a Turkish hospital in the border city of Edirne where he succumbed to hypothermia. Dozens of migrants found on the Turkish-Greek border claim that they were beaten by Greek border officials and forcibly returned to Turkey.

Based on the accounts of the illegally deported migrants, Greek police officers have been accused of confiscating the migrants' valuable possessions and of torture."

Western Asia,2017-12-21,7.0,,7,,,,2.0,Syrian Arab Republic,Western Asia,Violence,Syrian Arab Republic,Syria to Türkiye,"Syria-Türkiye border at al-Dirriyah, Daraa Governorate, Syria",https://bit.ly/2IFZjr8,4,"Click to expand Image A Turkish soldier surveys the border line between Turkey and Syria near the city of Kilis, March 2, 2017. © 2017 Reuters/Murad Sezer

(Brussels) – Turkish security forces have routinely intercepted hundreds, and at times thousands, of asylum seekers at the Turkey-Syria border since at least December 2017 and summarily deported them to the war-ravaged Idlib governorate in Syria, Human Rights Watch said today. Turkish border guards have shot at asylum seekers trying to enter Turkey using smuggling routes, killing and wounding them, and have deported to Idlib newly arrived Syrians in the Turkish town of Antakya, 30 kilometers from the Syrian border.

The Russian-Syrian military alliance’s December offensive against anti-government forces in Idlib has displaced almost 400,000 civilians, according to the UN. They have joined more than 1.3 million others trapped inside Idlib in insecure, overcrowded camps, and in makeshift camps in fields near the closed Turkish border where they are under constant threat of attack and lack food, clean water, shelter, health care, and aid. At a March 26, 2018 summit meeting in Bulgaria, the European Union should press Turkey to allow Syrian civilians fleeing fighting to seek protection inside Turkey and pledge increased aid to Syrian refugees in Turkey and the region.

“As border guards try to seal the last remaining gaps in Turkey’s border, hundreds of thousands of Syrians are trapped in fields to face the bombs on the Syrian side,” said Gerry Simpson, associate refugee rights program director at Human Rights Watch. “The EU should press Turkey to open its border to those in need, and provide meaningful support, not silently stand by as Turkey ignores refugee law and pushes thousands back to face the carnage.”

In response to these allegations, the Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) in Turkey’s Ministry of Interior provided Human Rights Watch with a lengthy statement , which said, in part, that “while maintaining the security of borders against terrorist organizations, Turkey continues to accept Syrians in need coming to the borders, and never opens fire on or uses violence against them.”

The DGGM said that it registered 510,448 Syrians coming through the designated border gates in 2017, and 91,866 so far in 2018, and provided them with temporary protection. As seen from the numbers, the DGMM statement said, “allegations suggesting that Syrians are not registered are not true.” It does not appear that Turkish authorities conducted an investigation into Human Rights Watch’s specific findings.

In mid-February, Human Rights Watch spoke by phone with 21 Syrians about their repeated failed attempts to cross into Turkey with smugglers. Eighteen of them said that intensified Russia-Syrian airstrikes in Deir al-Zour and in Idlib had repeatedly displaced them until they finally decided they had no option but to risk their lives and flee to Turkey.

Those interviewed described 137 incidents, almost all between mid-December and early March, in which Turkish border guards intercepted them just after they had crossed the border with smugglers. Human Rights Watch spoke with another 35 Syrians stuck in Idlib who had not tried to escape for fear of being shot by border guards.

Nine people also described 10 incidents between September and early March in which Turkish border guards shot at them or others ahead of them as they tried to cross, killing 14 people, including 5 children, and injuring 18.

Civilians in Idlib have also been caught in the crossfire between Kurdish and Turkish forces during the offensive by Turkey in the Kurdish-held town of Afrin in Syria, north of Idlib, which began on January 20.

In November, the United Nations refugee agency said in its latest country guidance on Syria that “all parts of Syria are reported to have been affected, directly or indirectly, by one or multiple conflicts” and therefore maintained its long-standing call on all countries “not to forcibly return Syrians.”

Syrians who tried to enter Turkey said they were intercepted after they crossed the Orontes River or near the internally displaced persons camp in al-Dureyya. They said Turkish border guards deported them along with hundreds, and at times thousands, of other Syrians they had intercepted. They said the guards forced them to return to Syrian territory at an informal crossing point at Hatya or across a small dam on the Orontes River known as the Friendship Bridge that aid agencies have used.

Human Rights Watch obtained satellite images of both crossing points and of four security posts with large tents set up on basketball courts in the immediate border area where asylum seekers said they were held before being sent back to Syria.

The findings follow a February 3 Human Rights Watch report on Turkey’s border killings and summary pushbacks of asylum seekers between May and December 2017 and similar findings in November 2015 and May 2016.

In response to the February 3 report, a senior Turkish official repeated his government’s long-standing response to such reports, pointing out that Turkey has taken in millions of Syrian refugees. Human Rights Watch described its latest findings in a letter on March 15 to Turkey’s interior minister, requesting comment by March 21.

Turkey is hosting over 3.5 million Syrian refugees, according to the UN refugee agency. Turkey deserves credit and support for its generosity and is entitled to secure its border with Syria.

However, Turkey is also obliged to respect the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they face a real risk of persecution, torture, or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. This includes a prohibition on rejecting asylum seekers at borders that would expose them to such threats. Turkey is also obliged to respect international norms on the use of lethal force as well as the rights to life and bodily integrity.

Turkey insists that it respects the principle of nonrefoulement. “Syrians are accepted and taken under protection in Turkey and Syrians who have entered into Turkey somehow and demand protection are definitely not sent back and the reception and registration procedures are carried out,” the DGMM’s statement in response to this report said. “Syrians coming to Turkey are under no circumstances forced to go back to their own country; their registration is continuing and these foreigners can benefit from many rights and services in Turkey.”

As of December, Turkey had completed almost 800 kilometers of a planned 911-kilometer border barrier with Syria, which consists of a rocket-resistant concrete wall and steel fence. The satellite imagery Human Rights Watch obtained of the area where Syrians say they crossed with smugglers shows areas without a wall.

Turkey’s continued refusal since at least mid-2015 to allow Syrian asylum seekers to cross the border legally has been reinforced by a controversial EU-Turkey March 2016 migration agreement to curb refugee and migration flows to the European Union. The EU should instead be working with Turkey to keep its borders open to refugees, providing financial support for Turkey’s refugee efforts, and sharing responsibility by stepping up resettlement of refugees from Turkey, Human Rights Watch said.

“The EU should stop ignoring Turkey’s mass refugee deportations,” Simpson said. “The meeting in Bulgaria is a clear opportunity for the EU governments and institutions to change course and ramp up efforts to help Turkey protect Syrian refugees including through increased refugee resettlement.”

Turkey’s land borders are legally protected by army border units of the Turkish Armed Forces. Gendarmerie also on duty at the borders operate under the authority of the land forces command. There are also gendarmerie stations near the borders charged with regular rural policing activities. This report refers to border guards without specifying if they are soldiers or gendarmes since many of those interviewed did not provide or do not have such specific information.

Regular Mass Pushbacks at the Turkish Border

Between February 14 and 20, Human Rights Watch interviewed the 21 Syrian asylum seekers who had tried multiple times to cross the border. Human Rights Watch interviewed them by cell phone and explained the purpose of the interviews and gave assurances of anonymity. We also received interviewees’ consent to describe their experiences.

They described 137 incidents – 107 of them between January 1 and March 6 – in which Turkish border guards intercepted them at the border near the Syrian town of Darkush and held them at nearby security posts and then deported them back to Syria with hundreds, and at times thousands, of others.

A man from Deir al-Zour governorate who fled Syrian government attacks on his village in September 2017 said border guards intercepted him nine times in January and the first half of February in border areas close to the al-Dureyya displaced people’s camp in Syria.

Describing three incidents in February, he said:

Each time they insulted the men, calling them “Syrian traitors.” They forced some of them to collect firewood. Then they took all of us in military trucks to a basketball court at a security post near the Hatya border gate. There was also a big tent there. They put us all in the tent and kept us overnight. They didn’t give us any food or water or let us go to a proper toilet. There were so many in the tent, that we were spilling out into the open of the basketball court. We were hundreds of people. The next morning, they took us all back to the border in buses.

Three Syrians said they were deported with thousands of others. A man from al-Hamediyah who said Turkish border guards intercepted him 11 times between September and January said that he was usually deported with about 500 other people. However, he said that on one occasion, in January, the border guards gave the people they had intercepted trying to cross from Syria numbers and his was 3,890. He said he was one of the last to be put on buses and taken to the border.

Many people referred to two deportation points that they said were between 10 and 30 minutes’ drive from the security posts where border guards had held them: one was an informal border crossing at Hatya, and the other was a small dam on the Orontes River called “Friendship Bridge.” Human Rights Watch obtained satellite imagery of both crossing points and of four security posts in the immediate border area where asylum seekers said they crossed into Turkey.

A woman from Hama governorate who repeatedly tried to cross the border said she was deported six times during the first two weeks of February with groups she estimated to be between 50 and 600 other Syrians:

The second time, on around February 4, the border guards took us to a military post and put us in a big tent with 200 other people they had already caught. Four hours later, at about 8 a.m., they put us in large buses and drove us to the Friendship Bridge. There they told us to get out and walk across the river back into Syria.

The satellite imagery Human Rights Watch obtained confirms there are gaps in the wall the full length of the Orontes River, west of the Syrian town of Salkeen, and at various points between the southern tip of where the river meets the border and the Hatya border crossing.

Deportations from Antakya

Three Syrians said Turkish police had deported them or relatives from the town of Antakya, about 20 kilometers west of the Syrian border.

A man from Deir al-Zour governorate said:

I crossed the border at night with my wife and two daughters and about 20 other people in late December 2017 near the al-Dureyya [displacement] camp. The border guards didn’t find us. The smugglers took us to their house in Antakya, about two hours’ drive away. There were 20 other Syrians already there and they told us they had also crossed from Syria that night. Not long after that, Turkish police arrived at the house. They took all of us to a police station and held us there until the next morning. They took our fingerprints and photos. Then they took all of us in police vans to the border at Bab al-Hawa and sent us back to Syria.

A man from Hama governorate described what happened to his wife:

The Turks sent my wife back from Antakya twice. She told me everything that happened. The first time was a week ago [about February 10]. The smugglers drove her and about 10 other people from the border near the Orontes River up to Reyhanli and from there they drove to Antakya. They reached the edge of Antakya at about 6 a.m. Turkish police shot at the car’s wheels to force it to stop. They beat the driver and immediately put my wife and the others in a police van and drove them to the border at Bab al-Hawa. My wife crossed again four days later. The smugglers took her and about 10 others to a small house in a Turkish village near the border and then drove to a house in Antakya where there were already about 50 other Syrians who said they had arrived that night. Suddenly Turkish police arrived, at about 7 a.m. They wrote down their names and took photos. They put them in a big truck and took them to the Bab al-Hawa crossing. They held them there for the whole day and then sent them back to Syria.

Shootings by Border Guards

Nine Syrians interviewed described a total of 10 shooting incidents by Turkish border guards between September and March in which they said 14 people were killed and 18 injured.

In mid-February, a man from Deir al-Zour governorate said that in the previous five weeks he had tried four times to reach Turkey with his wife and five children. The first three times, he said, Turkish border guards deported them. The fourth time they turned back because Turkish border guards shot at their group as they approached the border:

A few hundred meters from the border near the al-Dureyya [displacement] camp the Turks suddenly started shooting at our group. They killed an 8-year-old girl and injured two men, one in a leg and the other in the stomach. I helped the man shot in the stomach turn back with the rest of us while the others carried the girl and helped the other man. Later the smugglers told us that a 13-year-old girl in another group trying to cross at the next time had also been killed during the shooting.

A man evacuated with his wife and baby from Aleppo in late 2016 said he unsuccessfully attempted to cross with them to Turkey three times near the al-Dureyya camp in September 2017 and January 2018 and was deported with hundreds of others the first two times. During the third attempt, in January, he said:

The border guards shot at us and injured my wife in her stomach and leg. She was pregnant and the baby died. They also injured two men and a 5-year-old boy, who was shot in the leg. We took my wife to a hospital in Syria near the border. Her heart stopped twice, but she lived. They couldn’t operate on her, so they sent her to Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa gate for surgery. They amputated her leg and removed her womb. They didn’t let me cross with her but a few days later a smuggler helped me and my daughter cross to Turkey.

Human Rights Watch also spoke with a doctor in a Syrian hospital near the Turkish border west of the town of Idlib who said that between August 1 and February 16, the hospital had received 66 people with gunshot-related injuries who said they had been shot while trying to cross the Turkish border.

Conflict and Humanitarian Crisis in Idlib governorate

According to the UN, about 2.65 million people are currently in Idlib governorate, over 1.75 million of whom have been displaced from elsewhere in Idlib or other parts of Syria, including almost 400,000 displaced since December. Civilians in Idlib have faced years of conflict. In September, Russian and Syrian forces began a fresh offensive in Idlib, three days after Russia, Iran, and Turkey had agreed to a ceasefire and “de-escalation” zone in the province and parts of Hama and western Aleppo. Human Rights Watch documented that attacks in September struck markets and populated residential areas and caused thousands of people to flee to displacement sites near the Turkish border.

Hostilities in Idlib halted on October 8 after Turkey deployed monitors there, but restarted in late December. In January, the Russian-Syrian military alliance carried out airstrikes to support Syrian ground troops. Some attacks involved prohibited weapons and targeted hospitals.

On January 21, Turkey started a military offensive in Kurdish-held Afrin , also putting displaced civilians at risk. Turkish and Kurdish forces have shelled each other on either side of Syria’s Atma displacement camp, on the Turkish border, which shelters 60,000 people.

Witnesses said that on February 6, during the fighting, shells hit the camp, killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring seven other civilians.

Human Rights Watch interviewed seven displaced Syrians about the incident. They all said it left their children terrified of the shelling and unable to sleep.

A father of seven children from Hama who lived close to where the shell landed on February 6 said:

I was there when it happened and rushed to help. I heard a young girl had been killed, but I only saw two who were injured. One had lost an arm and a leg and the other was blinded. I was so scared the same might happen to my children, we fled the camp and went to live in a field near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. But we couldn’t stay there all alone, without help, so we had to come back to the camp. We are all scared now, all the time.

A father of four children said the incident had so shaken his family, he had returned to his still conflict-riven home town of Kafr Zita in Hama governorate because all other displacement camps in Idlib were full. As his house had been destroyed, he said, he was living in a field on the edge of the town and struggling to survive: “There is still shelling here but if we die, it’s better to die at home.”

Human Rights Watch also spoke with five Syrians who had been repeatedly displaced in recent months within Idlib to escape the shifting front line and who, as of mid-February, were living as close as possible to the Turkish border in the hope of escaping the fighting.

The UN says that since December, the violence has displaced at least 385,000 people who have joined 2.65 million other civilians, including 1.35 million civilians displaced in the past few years.

In mid-February, Human Rights Watch interviewed two aid officials working in Idlib governorate. One summarized the dire humanitarian situation:

There is no more room anywhere for people displaced in the past few months. Displacement camps are completely full and we [humanitarians] do not have the resources to properly address basic needs of water, food, heating, health care, and education. Rent has skyrocketed so people end up living in the tens of thousands on the edge of towns and villages in fields in makeshift camps. There is simply no way the aid agencies can help all these people. At best they can give very limited help once in a while to some of them, and it is not done in an organized way. There is suffering everywhere, in every camp and in every village.

The 56 displaced Syrians in Idlib that Human Rights Watch interviewed, including 42 displaced by the recent violence, all described the extremely difficult conditions they had faced in Idlib in previous months. The newly displaced said they had heard that displacement camps were completely full and that they could not afford to pay the extremely high rents in the towns and villages in the area. They ended up living in waterlogged fields across Idlib governorate, often with other families in makeshift tents made from sacks and other material sewed together, because they could not afford to buy proper tents.

They said they struggled to find food and had to pay high fees for water, delivered by trucks. They either had seen no one from an aid agency, or those who had, said they were unable to help or had promised help but hadn’t returned.

Turkish authorities have allowed Turkish and international aid groups based in Turkey to cross into Syria and join Syrian aid groups to distribute tents and other assistance to Syrians in camps in border areas. Human Rights Watch said that allowing much-needed cross-border aid is important, but does not absolve Turkey of its obligation to allow Syrian civilians fleeing fighting to seek protection in Turkey.

EU Silence

Human Rights Watch has documented that, since at least mid-August 2015, Turkish border guards enforcing the country’s March 2015 border closure have deported Syrians trying to reach Turkey. In April and May 2016, Human Rights Watch documented Turkish border guards shooting and beating Syrian asylum seekers trying to cross to Turkey, resulting in deaths and serious injuries, and sending those who managed to cross back to Syria. In February 2018, Human Rights Watch reported on further killings, injuries and pushbacks that happened in the second half of 2017.

On May 20, 2016, Human Rights Watch called on UN member states and UN agencies attending the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul to press the Turkish authorities to reopen Turkey’s border to Syrian asylum seekers. But neither the European Commission nor any European Union member state – or any other country – has publicly pressed Turkey to do so, while UN agencies have also remained publicly silent.

The world’s – and in particular the EU’s – silence over Turkey’s breach of the cornerstone of international refugee law condones Turkey’s border abuses.

The EU’s failure to take in more Syrian asylum seekers and refugees also contributes to the pressure on Turkey. The EU should swiftly fulfill its own commitments to relocate Syrian and other asylum seekers from Greece and, together with other countries, it should also expand safe and legal channels for people to reach safety from Turkey, including through increased refugee resettlement, humanitarian admissions, humanitarian and other visas, and facilitated family reunification."

The baby's body was discovered off Turkey's Aegean shore near an overcrowded dinghy that was carrying illegal migrants who were trying to make the ambitious yet deadly journey to reach Europe.

The Turkish Coast Guard were patrolling the Aegean Sea off İzmir province yesterday when they found the lifeless body of 18-month-old Revan Hassun while intercepting a nearby dinghy boat which was carrying undocumented migrants. Migrants were among hundreds who try to make it to Europe in search of better lives. Boy's body was transferred to the Forensic Medicine Institute in İzmir for an autopsy. The coast guard also intercepted 76 undocumented migrants en route to Greece on a boat off İzmir's Dikili district. Seventy-four of the held migrants were Syrian nationals, including children, while the remaining two were citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Currently, Turkish gendarmerie forces are holding 65 foreign nationals suspected of irregular migration in Dikili district. Fifty-two Syrians, nine Afghans and four Angolans are among the suspects, who have been transferred to migration management authorities.

Turkey is a main route for refugees trying to cross into Europe, especially since the beginning of the civil war in Syria. The country is both a transit and final destination for migrants, particularly from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Congo, Bangladesh, Somalia and the Palestinian territories.

In recent years, hundreds of thousands of people have tried to make the short but perilous journey across the Aegean Sea to reach northern and western Europe. Although the Turkish Coast Guard has rescued thousands of people, a countless number of refugees have died trying to undertake the treacherous voyage. Since the beginning of 2017, at least 51 people have lost their lives in the dangerous sea journeys.

In March 2016, Turkey and the EU signed a deal to discourage irregular migration through the Aegean Sea by taking stricter measures against human traffickers and improving the conditions of some 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. Since then, the number of refugees detained crossing the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece has fallen 85 percent, according to the Turkish Coast Guard. Still, a small number of migrants continue to risk their lives on a daily basis to reach Greece, while EU countries bicker over quotas on the number of migrants each supposedly should take and the burden of hosting refugees.

At the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, more than 857,000 migrants reached Greece from Turkey. The highest number of migrants intercepted by the Coast Guard was in September this year when authorities caught a total of 3,408 migrants offshore. Over the past seven years, the country has intercepted more than 640,000 irregular migrants."

The unidentified body was found late Thursday in the icy Evros River with police announcing the discovery on Friday.

Thousands of refugees and migrants enter Greece every year from Turkey on their way to Europe's more prosperous heartland, where they hope to make a better life. Most choose the short sea crossing in flimsy smuggling boats to the eastern Aegean islands.

Greece has built a fence along part of its land border with Turkey, but many migrants still cross the Evros.

Earlier this week, hundreds of refugees were rescued across off the coast in Libya before rough weather hit the area.

Some 255 migrants were rescued in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya overnight, just before a front of bad weather hit the area, the Italian coastguard said on Tuesday.

The non-governmental organisation Proactiva Open Arms picked up a rubber dinghy carrying 134 people, including seven children, on Monday night. They were to be transferred to the Aquarius rescue ship operated by another NGO, SOS Mediterranean, before being taken to Pozzallo in Sicily.

A military ship from the European anti-smuggling operation Sophia also rescued 121 people aboard two other boats, the coastguard said.

According to the Italian daily La Repubblica, smugglers have lowered the price of a crossing to 400 euros ($475) per person, in part due to the bad winter weather, but they are still cramming as many migrants as possible into the dinghies.

In 2017 alone, over 3,000 migrants have died while making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, according to the Missing Migrants Project."

The 31-year-old was the fourth migrant to die this year in the area around the port, a launchpad for attempts by migrants to smuggle across the Channel to England.

He was buried under several tonnes of paper rolls bound for a British customer after the driver lost control of the truck and it overturned, regional security officials said.

Last week, an Afghan migrant died after being run over on the road leading to the port.

The number of fatalities has however fallen dramatically since 2016 when 14 migrants died while trying to reach Britain - a popular destination for Afghans and east Africans particularly.

Migrant numbers in Calais have dwindled to a trickle after the authorities late last year bulldozed a settlement on the outskirts of the port where thousands of people had been sheltering and bussed them to shelters around the country.

Since then the police has relentlessly pursued young Africans and Asians who try to set up camp in the area, drawing sharp criticism from rights groups.

At the other end of France, attempts by migrants to get into the country from Italy have also led to fatalities.

On Wednesday, the body of a young African migrant was found on the motorway that links the French Riviera city of Nice to Italy.

Police believe the man in his twenties fell from a shack he had been staying in on some sort of ledge above the road near the town of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.

At least 15 migrants have died in southern France since September 2015, according to a count kept by AFP news agency.

The latest victim there likely came via the Italian border town of Ventimiglia, which has become a launching pad for migrants who make it to Italy and seek to head north into France.

Increased border patrols have made it much harder for them to do so, so many are now braving the snow-clad Alps further north in efforts to evade immigration police and reach France from Italy.

They often take treacherous high-altitude passes that locals warn will lead to deaths.

President Emmanuel Macron has adopted a two-pronged approach to migrants, cracking down on those labelled economic migrants because they are fleeing poverty rather than danger while promising to open up new avenues for refugees to travel to France legally.

In July he promised to find temporary shelter for all those on the streets by the end of 2017 - a goal he looks nearly certain to miss, with many still sleeping rough around the country."

Según estadísticas del Ministerio Público (MP) en esa región, unos siete migrantes perdieron la vida en 2017 intentando cruzar la espesa selva del Darién. Todos fueron sepultados en territorio panameño ya que fue imposible ubicar a los familiares de las víctimas.

La fiscal superior de Darién, Janeth Rovetto, señaló este miércoles a los medios que cuando se hallan estas personas, ""los cuerpos están en avanzado estado de descomposición"".

""A veces no se logra ubicar el resto del grupo. Generalmente no es una sola persona, son varias las que usan la ruta de Panamá, con destino de Estados Unidos. No se logra ubicar a quiénes acompañaban, no se tiene identidad"", añadió Rovetto.

También fueron decomisadas unas 10 toneladas de droga, entre marihuana y cocaína, que estaban siendo transportadas por mochileros y bandas criminales entre la frontera de Panamá y Colombia.

They died at the hands of human smugglers attempting to move them around the centrally-located U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.

“We had 52 people die in our county this year while trying to bypass the Falfurrias Checkpoint,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas in a phone interview on Wednesday. “They die because these callous human smugglers have no regard for human life. These people are just cargo to them.”

Martinez said the only good thing about this number is that it is less than the previous year. In 2016, 61 illegal immigrants died in Brooks County. This represents a decrease of about 15 percent.

“We have worked very hard this year with our partners to reduce the number of deaths in our county,” Martinez explained. “The U.S. Border Patrol and Texas Department of Public Safety have both increased their presence in the county. The number of rescues in the brush by Border Patrol agents helped keep the number down.

The number could have been much lower in 2017 were it not for a cold snap that hit the region in mid-December. Brooks County Sheriff’s Office Deputies and Border Patrol agents recovered the bodies of eight migrants between December 7 and 14, Breitbart Texas reported.

Nationally, nearly 300 illegal aliens died during Fiscal Year 2017. Brooks County accounted for about 10 to 15 percent of the reported deaths.

Martinez expressed concern for 2018 as the opening of an expanded Border Patrol checkpoint in his county will likely force more people into the brush.

“The more people that are pushed into the ranchlands with these human smugglers, the more deaths we are likely to have,” the sheriff explained. “These smugglers just don’t care about the lives of these people. If they fall behind for any reason — these smugglers abandon them and leave them for dead.”

Some are lucky enough to find their way to a roadway for help. Some have cell phones and manage to call for help,” Martinez stated. “In 2017, 52 of these people had neither and died agonizing deaths from dehydration, heat exhaustion, or hypothermia.”"

Press Release

Military-style solutions won’t solve humanitarian problems, argues our new report that details the nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the English Channel since 1999. Deadly Crossings and the Militarisation of Britain’s Borders reveals the human tragedies caused by inhumane border enforcement at a time when the UK Home Office is seeking to make Channel crossings ‘unviable’

A transnational collaboration between the IRR, the Permanent People’s Tribunal London steering group & French group Gisti, Deadly Crossings is the first English-language analysis of Channel-related deaths. Published within weeks of the UK exit from the European Union, the report argues that far from the UK getting a handle on border control post-Brexit, further securitisation of its borders will only result in more human suffering.

PPT member, Don Flynn said, “The UK government tries to present migrant Channel crossings as a failing on the French side. But much of the hardship in the Calais region stems from the refusal of the British government to provide a safe passage for people with a legitimate claim to asylum in this country. This report is a tool for people who believe that the UK’s border policies need to be changed. What exists at the moment is nothing more than the extension of the brutality of the hostile environment to refugees.”

Translated from a publication originally written in French by Maël Galisson of Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France, the report features a timeline which shows the deaths chronologically; and an interactive map, showing them geographically.

With no official records chronicling the deaths of people trying to cross the Channel, the total number cannot be known, but it is hoped this report will give each person included an identity and a history. Galisson said, “This report is about challenging the idea that this massacre is the result of misfortune. Reducing these tragedies to accidents or framing them in terms of violence occurring between migrants, as we often see in the media, is a way of concealing the responsibility of public authorities for a situation that has lasted for more than twenty years”.

IRR Vice-Chair Frances Webber said, “These deaths are not ‘natural’ nor ‘tragic accidents’ but man-made, created by policies which do not merely close borders but also erect ever more obstacles to safe travel for the most vulnerable. Military-style solutions don’t solve humanitarian problems. They simply create more profit for the smugglers, and more suffering for the migrants. The history of the securitisation of the English Channel is a history of death. So why do we allow the government to keep on along the same path?"

Europe,2018-01-02,,1.0,1,1.0,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Drowning,Slovenia,Western Balkans,"Kolpa/Kupa river, near Ukovaci, municipality of Črnomelj, Slovenia",http://bit.ly/2oOTrni,3,"Prebežniki, ki skušajo nelegalno prečkati južno mejo, zaradi bodeče žice iščejo druge, nezavarovane poti. Vse več se jih s čolni ali celo brez skuša prebiti čez Kolpo, ki ima okoli pet stopinj.

V nedeljo dopoldne so črnomaljski policisti pa so v nedeljo dopoldne pri naselju Miliči prijeli tri državljane Alžirije in državljana Maroka, ki so v Slovenijo vstopili tako, da so preplavali reko Kolpo. Po zaključenem postopku so jih nastanili v azilnem domu.

Iz Kolpe so jih reševali gasilci

2. januarja v zgodnjih jutranjih urah je reka Kolpa odnesla dve osebi, ki sta mejo skušali prečkati pri naselju Učakovci pri Vinici v občini Črnomelj. Gasilcem je s pomočjo čolna eno osebo uspelo rešiti, drugo je voda odnesla. Gasilci so pregledali teren ob reki Kolpi med Vinico in Učakovci, vendar pogrešane osebe niso našli.

31. januarja so reki Kolpi, v kraju Ladešići na hrvaški strani, našli moško truplo, preiskava je pokazala, da je šlo za prebežnika. Skupina petih prebežnikov naj bi Kolpo skušala prečkati s čolni.

Iščejo prehode, kjer ni žice

Na državni meji ob Kolpi je 89 kilometrov fizičnih ovir, migranti zato Kolpo skušajo prečkati v nočnih urah predvsem na mejnih točkah, ki niso zaščitene z žično ali panelno ograjo. Pri tem si pomagajo s čolni, ki jih odtujijo na hrvaški strani Kolpe, ali pa skušajo reko kljub zimskim razmeram prebresti in tudi preplavati.

""Reka bo spomladi naplavila nova trupla""

Prebivalci hrvaškega kraja Ladešići pravijo, da je žrtev Kolpe, še več, poroča Jutarnji list. Kolpa, ki ima te dni okoli pet stopinj Celzija, naj bi odnesla vsaj še enega migranta. Hrvaški novinarji so se pogovarjali s prebivalci na slovenski strani meje. Igor Zalokar, ki živi ob Kolpi, jim je tako dejal, da bo zgodaj poleti, ko bo reka nekoliko upadla, naplavilo še kakšno truplo. Tudi sam se je srečal z migranti, ki so prečkali reko.

Moker in premražen prosil pred vrati

""Prišla je tašča in dejala, da je slišala kričanje ter videla ljudi, ki hodijo okrog hiše. Oblekel sem se in pred vhodnimi vrati našel mlajšega moškega, ki je bil ves moker in se je tresel od mraza. V nepovezani angleščini mi je dejal, da ga zebe ter me prosil za jakno. Peljal sem ga v kurilnico, kjer se je ogrel ter mu dal suho obleko ter nekaj za jesti in piti. Dejal, da so z njim bili še trije,” je opisal Zalokar.

Krepitev migrantskega pritiska

Policija je krepitev migrantskega pritiska na schengensko mejo zaznala septembra lani, ko so na metliškem območju med Bubnjarci in Rosalnicami prijeli 76 migrantov, od katerih jih je 56 zaprosilo za mednarodno zaščito. Zaradi okrepljenega delovanja policije na omenjenem območju se je nato migrantska pot premaknila gorvodno na črnomaljsko območje. Na področju policijske postaje Črnomelj so policisti lani evidentirali 14 migrantov. V prvem mesecu in pol letošnjega leta je mejo prečkalo že 112 migrantov."

One of the boats sank and the other was badly overcrowded, coastguard officials said.

Survivors said that several dozen migrants were unaccounted for and were feared to have drowned.

The boats were at sea near Garabulli, where departures have become more common since local armed groups began preventing boats from leaving from the coast to the west of Tripoli last summer.

Slightly fewer than half as many migrants reached Europe by sea in 2017 than 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), largely because of a drop in crossings between Libya and Italy.

The IOM said that nearly 120,000 migrants docked in Italy over the course of last year, out of a total of more than 171,500 who arrived in Europe by sea, mostly fleeing war in the Middle East and poverty in Africa.

A Deadly Start to the New Year for Migrants on the Mediterranean

Tripoli – The Libyan Coast Guard reported Wednesday that up to 100 migrants remain missing in the third deadly shipwreck on the Mediterranean Sea since Saturday. Now, barely a week into the New Year there already are reports of close to 200 migrants or refugees dead or missing on the Central Mediterranean route.

By contrast, IOM recorded just 26 migrant deaths on the Mediterranean Sea lanes during the just-ended month of December 2017, at a time when Mediterranean migrants deaths were dropping sharply. January 2017, for example, had witnessed some 254 deaths. Now, this week’s reports suggest that 2018’s start may be even deadlier.

IOM reported on Tuesday 09 January that a total of 81 Mediterranean Sea deaths of migrants or refugees were recorded in the first eight days of the year. Five of those deaths were in Western Mediterranean waters off Spain and Morocco. The rest – 76 with a possibility of many more – were recorded in the waters between Italy and Libya.

In the latest incident for this year, on Tuesday 9 January, three rubber boats with 279 migrants (19 women, 243 men, 13 boys and four girls) were rescued by the Libyan Coast Guard (Watch video), whose rescue operation lasted at least 12 hours.

Reuters spoke to survivors who say that about 50 people who had boarded the boats now are missing, while Libya’s Coast Guard stated in a press release it believes that number might be as high as 100.

According to survivors’ testimony, around 100 migrants remain missing. IOM, the UN Migration Agency, was present at their disembarkation point in Tripoli and provided food and water to all survivors.

IOM’s Christine Petré reported that the boats departed from near the Libyan coastal towns of Azzawiyah and Al Khums. The majority of the survivors came from African countries including The Gambia, Senegal, Sudan, Mali, and Nigeria. The Libyan Cost Guard reported that eight survivors are from Bangladesh (one woman) while two are from Pakistan.

“It’s very distressing that during the first 10 days of 2018 we have seen close to 800 migrants rescued or intercepted off the Libyan coast with more lives lost at sea,” said Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission. “More has to be done to reduce irregular unsafe movements of people along the Central Mediterranean route.”

IOM continues today to provide support and direct humanitarian assistance to the survivors of this latest tragedy, many of whom now are at Libya’s Tajoura detention centre."

Mediterranean,2018-01-16,3.0,,3,,,3.0,2.0,Eritrea,Eastern Africa,Mixed or unknown,Libya,Central Mediterranean,Unspecified location off the coast of Libya,http://tmsnrt.rs/2rhg33h,4,"More than 20,000 have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration estimates

ROME, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Some 1,400 migrants were plucked from overcrowded boats off the coast of Libya on Tuesday, Italy's coastguard said, and two bodies were recovered.

Vessels belonging to the Italian coastguard and finance police, the European Union anti-smuggling operation, Sophia, and ships run by humanitarian groups took part in 11 rescue operations, a statement said.

No details about the nationalities of those rescued were given, nor was there further information about the deaths.

Though hundreds of thousands of migrants have reached Europe via Italy after setting off in boats from North Africa over the past four years, it is unusual to see so many rescued on a single day during the winter when the seas tend to be rough.

So far this year 974 migrants had reached Italy by sea, down from 2,393 during the same period last year, the Interior Ministry said earlier on Tuesday before the latest rescues.

Immigration is one of the hot-button issues ahead of a national election on March 4. The ruling Democratic Party has pointed to a sharp fall in arrivals from Libya since July as proof that it is now managing what before seemed like an endless flow of migrant boats.

Arrivals fell by a third last year to 119,000 compared with a year earlier, and they tumbled by two thirds in the second half of the year. The declines came after a deal with the Tripoli government sealed in February, which foresaw aid and training for the Libyans to fight people smuggling and to bolster their coastguard.

More than 20,000 are estimated to have died attempting the crossing to Italy in the past four years, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates, making it the deadliest border for migrants in the world.

The Northern League, which is a member of the centre-right coalition leading in polls ahead of the vote, on Monday vowed to stop the migrant ""invasion"".

These tragic deaths illustrate the desperation of those trying to reach safety in Lebanon, and remind us that the situation inside Syria remains very difficult and that people continue to take huge risks to cross to safety.

Civil Defense members found the body near to the official crossing point’s General Security center and transferred the body to the hospital. The source said that the woman had been attempting to cross into Lebanon irregularly when she died.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the woman was part of a group of Syrian refugees that was caught in last week’s storm, resulting in the death of over a dozen persons due to exposure suffered during the treacherous crossing.

Sixteen bodies were retrieved on the mountainous outskirts of the Bekaa border town of Suweiri. Those who died were believed to be part of a larger group of at least 20 that had planned to cross from Syria.

The group was making the crossing early Friday morning when the storm struck, bringing high winds, snow and plunging temperatures.

L'accident s'est produit alors que le ministre de l'Intérieur Jan Jambon venait d'annoncer un renforcement de la surveillance des parkings autoroutiers les plus fréquentés par les migrants en quête d'un passage vers le Royaume-Uni. ""C'est un incident regrettable, mais la police a fait son travail normalement, elle n'est pas en faute"", a déclaré mardi matin M. Jambon à la chaîne flamande VRT.



""On ne peut pas exclure que des gens fassent certaines choses, mais tout le monde sait que traverser une autoroute est dangereux"", a-t-il ajouté. Le cabinet du ministre a affirmé en outre que ce contrôle de police, sur l'autoroute E40 à Jabbeke près d'Ostende (nord), était prévu de longue date, même s'il ""s'inscrit dans le plan d'actions"" annoncé le week-end dernier par Jan Jambon, d'après l'agence Belga.

""Quelques personnes qui étaient à côté de l'autoroute ont voulu traverser pour prendre la fuite et malheureusement en faisant ça l'une d'elles a été percutée par une voiture"", a précisé Sarah Frederickx, porte-parole de la police fédérale.

(Foto Prensa Libre: Carlos Ventura)

Ahora, a la espera de que regrese el cadáver, la familia vive angustia y permanece consternada. Ricarda Tomás Sánchez, madre del migrante de 29 años, dijo que su hijo les comunicó a finales del 2017 su decisión de viajar a aquel país para ir trabajar.



El 1 de enero, a las 5 horas, salió de su casa en el barrio San Marcos, zona 1 de Concepción Chiquirichapa,

Indicó esa era la tercera ocasión que intentaba ingresar a ese país. Las dos primeras veces fue detenido y deportado. En la segunda ocasión lo acompañó su esposa.

“Saúl era mi único hijo, ahora está muerto. Yo ya no puedo trabajar y ahora me he quedado sola con mi nuera y mis dos nietos. Supe que murió porque lo identificaron por su DPI y nos llamaron para darnos la mala noticia”, dijo Tomás Sánchez; sin embargo, no saben la causa de la muerte.

La esposa de Sánchez Tomás, Olga Cristóbal Cortez, de 28 años, dijo que su esposo finalizó el año pasado sus estudios de mecánica automotriz en el Instituto Técnico de Capacitación (Intecap) y decidió viajar a Estados Unidos para trabajar, ganar dinero y comprar herramientas para instalar su propio taller.

Indicó que tienen dos hijos, Dilan y Brandon Eduardo Sánchez Cristóbal, de 3 y 8 años, respectivamente, el mayor cursa tercero primaria.



“Cuando se fue se levantó muy temprano y fue a la cocina, cuando bajé para ver si necesitaba algo me dijo que me fuera a dormir y esa fue la última vez que lo vi. Luego llamó para decirme que ya se había ido. Él no pagó coyote y se llevó poco dinero”, relató Cristóbal Cortez.

Añadió que su esposo quería comprar una casa y el terreno para el taller. Siempre añoró eso, pero no se podía comprar aquí porque no se gana bien, así que el sueño era irse por poco tiempo y luego regresar”, explicó.



Piden ayuda

Joaquín Tomás, tío del fallecido, solicitó apoyo a las autoridades para repatriar los restos de su sobrino, pues la familia es de escasos recursos.

Hizo un llamado a la población para ayudar a la familia Sánchez Tomás, ya que se han quedado solos y hay dos niños huérfanos. Quienes deseen apoyar pueden comunicarse por el teléfono 5842-8193.

Familiares dijeron que aún no saben cuándo podrían repatriar los restos de Sánchez Tomás, ya que hasta ahora solo han recibido información en la sede del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores en Xela."

Vse več se jih s čolni ali celo brez skuša prebiti čez Kolpo, ki ima okoli pet stopinj.

V nedeljo dopoldne so črnomaljski policisti pa so v nedeljo dopoldne pri naselju Miliči prijeli tri državljane Alžirije in državljana Maroka, ki so v Slovenijo vstopili tako, da so preplavali reko Kolpo. Po zaključenem postopku so jih nastanili v azilnem domu.

Iz Kolpe so jih reševali gasilci

2. januarja v zgodnjih jutranjih urah je reka Kolpa odnesla dve osebi, ki sta mejo skušali prečkati pri naselju Učakovci pri Vinici v občini Črnomelj. Gasilcem je s pomočjo čolna eno osebo uspelo rešiti, drugo je voda odnesla. Gasilci so pregledali teren ob reki Kolpi med Vinico in Učakovci, vendar pogrešane osebe niso našli.

31. januarja so reki Kolpi, v kraju Ladešići na hrvaški strani, našli moško truplo, preiskava je pokazala, da je šlo za prebežnika. Skupina petih prebežnikov naj bi Kolpo skušala prečkati s čolni.

Iščejo prehode, kjer ni žice

Na državni meji ob Kolpi je 89 kilometrov fizičnih ovir, migranti zato Kolpo skušajo prečkati v nočnih urah predvsem na mejnih točkah, ki niso zaščitene z žično ali panelno ograjo. Pri tem si pomagajo s čolni, ki jih odtujijo na hrvaški strani Kolpe, ali pa skušajo reko kljub zimskim razmeram prebresti in tudi preplavati.

""Reka bo spomladi naplavila nova trupla""

Prebivalci hrvaškega kraja Ladešići pravijo, da je žrtev Kolpe, še več, poroča Jutarnji list. Kolpa, ki ima te dni okoli pet stopinj Celzija, naj bi odnesla vsaj še enega migranta. Hrvaški novinarji so se pogovarjali s prebivalci na slovenski strani meje. Igor Zalokar, ki živi ob Kolpi, jim je tako dejal, da bo zgodaj poleti, ko bo reka nekoliko upadla, naplavilo še kakšno truplo. Tudi sam se je srečal z migranti, ki so prečkali reko.

Moker in premražen prosil pred vrati

""Prišla je tašča in dejala, da je slišala kričanje ter videla ljudi, ki hodijo okrog hiše. Oblekel sem se in pred vhodnimi vrati našel mlajšega moškega, ki je bil ves moker in se je tresel od mraza. V nepovezani angleščini mi je dejal, da ga zebe ter me prosil za jakno. Peljal sem ga v kurilnico, kjer se je ogrel ter mu dal suho obleko ter nekaj za jesti in piti. Dejal, da so z njim bili še trije,” je opisal Zalokar.

Krepitev migrantskega pritiska

Policija je krepitev migrantskega pritiska na schengensko mejo zaznala septembra lani, ko so na metliškem območju med Bubnjarci in Rosalnicami prijeli 76 migrantov, od katerih jih je 56 zaprosilo za mednarodno zaščito. Zaradi okrepljenega delovanja policije na omenjenem območju se je nato migrantska pot premaknila gorvodno na črnomaljsko območje. Na področju policijske postaje Črnomelj so policisti lani evidentirali 14 migrantov. V prvem mesecu in pol letošnjega leta je mejo prečkalo že 112 migrantov."

Middle Africa,2018-02-07,2.0,,2,,,,,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Middle Africa,Violence,Democratic Republic of the Congo,DRC to Uganda,"Shore of Lake Albert, Democratic Republic of the Congo",http://bit.ly/2HdBtCy,4,"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is deeply saddened by reports of four Congolese refugees who drowned as they were seeking safety in Uganda, after their boat capsized on Lake Albert.

UNHCR warns that even more lives could be lost on the often perilous lake routes, as increasing numbers of refugees escape intercommunal violence and conflict, across the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Last week, over 22,000 Congolese crossed Lake Albert to Uganda, bringing the total number of DRC arrivals in the country to about 34,000 since the beginning of the year. The refugees either use small canoes or overcrowded and rickety fishing boats, often carrying more than 250 people and taking up to ten hours to cross.

Overloaded with luggage and fishing nets, the small canoe, which was carrying the four refugees who drowned on 11 February, had paddled for nearly two days when it was hit by high waves, causing the passengers to fall overboard. UNHCR staff report several other incidents of boats going adrift due to engine failure or insufficient fuel, prompting rescue operations by the Ugandan authorities.

Meanwhile, on 7 February, UNHCR partners recorded two more deaths at the DRC shores of Lake Albert, where thousands of people are waiting to cross, as some wrangled to get onto the boats. With attacks on villages in the DRC province of Ituri continuing over the weekend, UNHCR calls for increased humanitarian access to the area, to cover the population’s enormous protection and assistance needs.

Refugees crossing to Uganda talk of growing attacks against civilian populations, as well as killings and destruction of private property. UNHCR staff also received many reports of civilians being hacked to death and killed with arrows. Last week, an elderly man died from exhaustion upon arrival in Uganda and a newborn did not survive complications during its birth. In addition to the port of Sebagoro, a small fishing village in the northern side of Lake Albert, refugees also have arrived in their hundreds in Canara, a new landing site on the southern end of Lake Albert.

UNHCR works with the Ugandan authorities for the registration and the relocation of the new arrivals to settlements further inland. However, more support is needed to face the demanding situation. Among the critical priorities is the preparation of new settlement areas, together with psycho-social interventions to help refugees overcome their trauma.

Meanwhile, crossings through Lake Tanganyika towards Burundi and Tanzania declined significantly last week, currently reaching some 8,000 and 1,200 respectively. Army advances against the armed groups inside DRC, as well as a dwindling supply of readily available fishing boats and canoes, may have contributed to the drop in new arrivals. However, UNHCR is afraid that flows could soon pick up again, given the unpredictable and volatile nature of the conflict.

Over the past year, some 120,000 Congolese fled to neighboring countries, joining the 510,000 refugees that were already in exile. With Congolese refugee flows to neighboring countries expected to further increase in 2018, UNHCR is urging donors to step up their support. From the US$368.7 million that UNHCR has requested for the DRC refugee situation, only 1 per cent has been funded so far.

According to Turkish media reports, the dead were identified as Ayşe Abdurrezzak, a 37-year-old teacher who was earlier dismissed from her job in the crackdown, and her children Abdulkadir Enes Abdurrezzak (11) and Halil Munir Abdurrezzak (3).

Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD) managed to recover the bodies of the three family members, while the four missing had yet to be found at the time of writing. The eighth had made it into Greece, according to AFAD.

Media said residents near the river heard screams and informed the gendarmerie.

According to people with knowledge of the situation, the boat was carrying three men, three children and two women.

One of the men, Ayşe’s husband, is also a teacher who was earlier dismissed from his job under a post-coup state of emergency decree.

Thousands of people have fled Turkey due to a massive witch-hunt launched by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government against sympathizers of the Gülen movement in the wake of a failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016. The government accuses the movement of masterminding the coup, while the movement denies any involvement.

Some 150,000 people have been detained, and nearly 60,000 including academics, judges, doctors, teachers, lawyers, students, policemen and others have been put in pretrial detention since the coup attempt. Meanwhile, 150,000 people have lost their jobs in the government’s post-coup purge of state institutions.

Many tried to flee Turkey illegally as the government had cancelled thousands of passports.

In November 2017, Huseyin Maden, a 40-year-old Kastamonu teacher, also dismissed in the aftermath of the failed coup, drowned along with his wife and three children while seeking to flee to the Greek island of Lesvos. (Turkey Purge)"

Tripoli - At nearly 3:00am on 14 February, a truck accident occurred, leaving 19 people dead and 49 people injured near Bani Waleed in Libya. The migrants on board reported that 180 people were crammed into the truck's cargo containers. They also said that the smugglers' truck crashed when it drove into a large hole in the road; overloaded with people, it became unbalanced. Out of the total migrants involved, approximately 138 were Eritrean, while the remaining were Somali and Ethiopian.

The area where the incident took place was 60 kilometres south-east of Bani Waleed, a transit location on a much-used migration route through the country to the coast. The smugglers were transporting the group of migrants from As Saddadah to Tarhuna.

Of the 19 reported victims, four were children, one was an adult woman and 14 were adult men. The wounded are reportedly to include ten children, nine adult women and 30 men.

IOM staff living in the area went to the scene to see what assistance could be provided. They helped transport some of the injured migrants to the local hospital. Two IOM doctors travelled to the hospital to support the emergency medical response. Together with the hospital staff, they assessed the cases, four of which IOM organized to be transferred to Tripoli due to the serious nature of their head injuries. All four are in critical condition in intensive care units. IOM is supporting the hospitals where they there transferred to with medical supplies.

There are six more cases in Bani Waleed hospital requiring referral to Tripoli. All of them have multiple injuries and some serious fractures requiring immediate surgery. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working on these transferals.

Many of the migrants, who were involved the accident are reported to have been taken by the smugglers to an unknown location.

""Our priority needs to be protecting these migrants and others throughout the country, while making migration through Libya safe and regular,"" said Othman Belbesi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission. ""One death whether in the desert or at sea is one too many,"" said Belbesi.

According to IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) report last December, there were over 621,000 migrants recorded in Libya but the true figure is estimated to be over 700,000, with the majority coming from Egypt, Niger, and Chad. Many migrants in Libya have faced ill-treatment and exploitation. IOM’s top priorities continue to be saving migrant lives, reducing irregular and unsafe movements of people along the central Mediterranean route, breaking the grip of traffickers and smugglers, identifying vulnerable persons and persons at risk throughout the migration process and assisting them, and improving conditions for migrants stranded in Libya. IOM provides humanitarian support to migrants in Libya, while advocating for improved longer term assistance and protection for them and all groups in the country.

Only two identification documents were found with the deceased.

On Valentine’s Day, agents assigned to the Falfurrias Border Patrol Station and Brooks County Sheriff’s Office deputies received a call from a rancher that discovered a set of skeletal remains. The agents went to the scene and recovered the remains, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officials. No identification documents were found with the deceased migrant.

The following day agents and deputies received two separate notices from ranchers about the discovery of additional remains. One of the deceased victims of cartel-connected human smugglers had a Salvadoran identification document near their remains. The second set were found on a different ranch near Falfurrias.

“It is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas. “Between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. The medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death.”

“These smugglers have no regard for human life,” the sheriff continued. “When a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can’t keep up with the pack, the smugglers simply leave them behind to die.”

The discovery of more skeletal remains continued the following day when federal agents and Kenedy County Sheriff’s Office deputies received a call from a rancher near Sarita, Texas. Sarita is the location of one of two Border Patrol Checkpoints located about 80 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley border with Mexico. The deputies and agents responded to the call from a rancher about the discovery of a deceased migrant. After a local justice of the peace declared the migrant to be dead, agents recovered the remains and transported them to a university for identification confirmation. Agents discovered a Honduran identification document near the deceased migrant’s remains.

Border Patrol officials caution that attempting to avoid the immigration checkpoints in South Texas is very dangerous.

In January, Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart Texas that the bodies and remains of nine illegal immigrants were recovered in just one month. The sheriff attributed the 30 percent increase over the previous January to an unusually strong cold snap.

“The cold snaps in January were devastating,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas in January. “Despite our best efforts to try and prevent the loss of lives, we ended up finding the bodies of nine people. Last year — we lost seven during the same period.”"

Agentes ministeriales asignados a la Zona Norte indagan los pormenores de los hechos, con el fin de determinar las circunstancias en las que el sujeto falleció, si se trató de un accidente o de una acción premeditada.Este caso fue reportado alrededor de la 1:30 horas del lunes en la vía Laredo-Torreón a la altura de las calles Profesionistas y Camino a la Carbonera, en la colonia Monclova.Hasta aquel lugar, ubicado a 10 kilómetros de la cabecera, se trasladaron inicialmente oficiales de la Policía Municipal y elementos de Protección Civil, quienes confirmaron el fallecimiento de la persona.De esa manera solicitaron la presencia del personal de la Agencia Estatal de Investigaciones, con el fin de que recolectaran evidencias y buscaran posibles testigos del fatal incidente.Se dio a conocer que el ahora occiso era un hombre de entre 30 y 35 años de edad, de tez aperlada y complexión delgada. Tenía cabello chino y vestía camiseta amarilla, con pantalón de mezclilla azul.La víctima, quien sufrió la amputación de ambas piernas, no portaba pertenencias ni documentos que permitieran conocer su identidad, por lo que hasta ahora no ha sido identificado.Fueron algunas personas que, durante los primeros minutos de la madrugada pasaban por aquel sitio, quienes reportaron el hallazgo y dieron parte a través del número de emergencias 911.Sin embargo, a la llegada del auxilio ya no hubo nada qué hacer por el desconocido, pues hacía varios minutos que había fallecido.Dentro de las primeras pesquisas las autoridades no descartan que el joven haya sido un migrante que viajaba ?de mosca? en el ferrocarril, buscando el llamado ?sueño americano?.Los restos del infortunado fueron trasladados al Servicio Médico Forense del hospital Universitario, en Monterrey, para corroborar la causa del fallecimiento, y espera la posible presencia de familiares que acudan a identificarlo.mvls"

« Sauveteurs et témoins : notre présence est plus que jamais nécessaire en Méditerranée »

Ce samedi 3 mars, l’Aquarius, affrété par SOS MEDITERRANEE et opéré en partenariat avec Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), a accueilli à son bord 72 survivants secourus par un navire marchand au cours de deux opérations tragiques en Méditerranée centrale. Quelques heures plus tôt, l’Aquarius avait été témoin direct de l’interception d’un canot en détresse dans les eaux internationales par les garde-côtes libyens.

72 survivants, de nombreux disparus

Parmi les 72 naufragés transbordés vers l’Aquarius samedi soir, 30 avaient été secourus la veille d’un canot en bois en train de couler et 42 autres ont sauté d’un canot pneumatique qui a ensuite été intercepté par les garde-côtes libyens, à 53 milles marins des côtes libyennes, dans les eaux internationales. Tous ont été sauvés par le navire marchand chypriote MV Everest.

Selon les témoignages des survivants recueillis à bord de l’Aquarius, de nombreuses personnes manquent à l’appel : 21 personnes, dont au moins une femme enceinte, se seraient noyées dans le naufrage du canot en bois et environ 90 ont été remmenées en Libye par les garde-côtes libyens, qui ont intercepté le canot pneumatique à bord duquel se trouvaient environ 130 personnes dont des femmes et des enfants.

Les naufragés recueillis à bord de l’Aquarius sont originaires de 12 pays différents, principalement d’Afrique de l’Ouest (Nigeria, Guinée-Conakry, Gambie, Ghana…), mais aussi du Soudan du Sud et du Soudan. Parmi eux, 3 femmes dont une est enceinte, et 14 mineurs, tous non accompagnés. Certains survivants montraient des signes d’épuisement physique, après avoir passé des mois en détention en Libye, mais aussi après une traversée en mer traumatisante.

« Nous étions 51 personnes sur le canot en bois. Mais quand les gens ont paniqué dans la nuit et que le canot a quasiment chaviré, des personnes sont tombées dans l’eau. Il y avait 5 femmes à bord, 4 se sont noyées, dont une femme enceinte. Moi, j’ai perdu mon frère, il est mort » a expliqué un jeune rescapé gambien aux volontaires de SOS MEDITERRANEE.

Interceptions

Quelques heures avant d’accueillir ces 72 naufragés à bord, samedi, l’Aquarius avait été mobilisé par le centre de coordination des secours de Rome (IMRCC) pour rechercher une embarcation en détresse dans les eaux internationales, à l’est de Tripoli. Lorsque l’Aquarius est arrivé à la position indiquée par un avion de l’opération EUNAVFORMED à 42 milles marins des côtes libyennes, l’embarcation était en train d’être interceptée par les garde-côtes libyens, qui ont décliné l’offre d’assistance des sauveteurs et médecins de l’Aquarius. Les passagers de l’embarcation, dont des femmes et des enfants, ont été remmenés en Libye.

Dimanche matin, alors que, suivant les instructions du Centre de coordination des secours de Rome (IMRCC), l’Aquarius cherchait un nouveau canot en détresse à l’ouest de Tripoli hors des eaux territoriales libyennes, une vedette des garde-côtes libyens s’est approchée à grande vitesse de l’Aquarius, suivant une trajectoire de collision dangereuse et non-conforme au code de la navigation, sans répondre aux appels radio de l’Aquarius. Le patrouilleur libyen a ensuite changé de trajectoire, s’est de nouveau approché, puis a ordonné à l’Aquarius avec agressivité, via radio, de s’éloigner, tandis que l’Aquarius l’informait conduire une opération de recherche suivant les instructions du MRCC Rome. Les garde-côtes libyens ont plus tard déclaré prendre en charge la coordination de l’opération de recherche du canot en détresse.

« L’Aquarius, seul bateau de recherche et sauvetage présent dans la zone samedi et dimanche a été impliqué pendant vingt-quatre heures dans des opérations de recherche complexes, réparties d’est en ouest, sur une distance d’environ 120 milles marins. La carence d’un dispositif de sauvetage adéquat a encore une fois eu un coût élevé en vies humaines : au moins 21 personnes se seraient noyées faute d’avoir été repérées et secourues à temps, et nous sommes sans nouvelles d’un bateau en détresse signalé dimanche matin. Enfin, le comportement dangereux et illégal d’unités des garde-côtes libyens ne fait qu’accentuer encore la dangerosité de cette zone de mer, déjà la plus meurtrière au monde » a déclaré Nicola Stalla, le coordinateur des opérations de sauvetage de SOS MEDITERRANEE.

L’Aquarius fait désormais route vers le nord pour le débarquement des 72 naufragés dans un port sûr en Italie.

« Des scénarios inacceptables se répètent et s’aggravent depuis plusieurs mois au vu et su d’autorités européennes trop sourdes aux appels de solidarité de l’Italie. Loin de combler les manques de ressources afin d’empêcher que de nouveaux drames ne se produisent, l’Europe laisse s’installer la plus grande confusion dans la zone de recherche et sauvetage au large des côtes libyennes. La conséquence en est la perte de nouvelles vies humaines et le retour vers l’enfer de ceux qui cherchaient à le fuir. Sauveteurs et témoins : notre présence est plus que jamais nécessaire en Méditerranée », a déclaré Francis Vallat, président de SOS MEDITERRANEE France.

According to Juan Ortega with Sunland Park Police Department, the two brothers who were undocumented immigrants who fled Border Patrol at the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.

The brothers made it to the area of McNutt Road and Camino Real when one of them collapsed, according to Ortega.

The other brother flagged down Border Patrol agents to help his brother.

Ortega said the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to Customs and Border Protection, on early Sunday morning agents were following two men suspected of entering the country illegally. They found the first man at an entrance to a landfill in Sunland Park.

The man told Border Patrol agents that his brother was in a culvert nearby and needed medical help. CBP said agents found the brother and he was not breathing. A Border Patrol EMT tried to revive him and so did Sunland Park EMTs, but the attempts failed.

Residents in nearby homes said they weren't surprised to hear the news.

“A lot of people cross illegally,"" said Sunland Park resident Ernesto Chuca. ""I live on the last street, and they stop there to hide. Sometimes they die along the way.""

""There’s always been border crossings here. It’s nothing new here,"" said Sunland Park resident Noah Roman. ""But for somebody to die just like that? That’s something to be concerned about. What happened? Why did he all of a sudden die?""

""I'm not surprised that a lot of people jump the border, because there's been many Border Patrol in this area. But I'm surprised he died,” said Sunland Park neighbor Rodrigo Arrelo. ""I don't think he cared. It was his brother. He probably didn't care if he got in trouble or not.""

""I've lived here all of my life. I can say it's pretty safe,” Roman said. ""You might see the fence, but there's still parts of it that's missing. So I'm pretty sure they're crossing through there, or there's always tunnels.""

The investigation is ongoing."

Rescue volunteers spray water on the charred wreckage of a van so they can retrieve the bodies of three Myanmar nationals trapped inside following a crash with a trailer truck in Sing Buri province early Saturday. (Photo taken from Sing Buri-based Ruamkatanyu rescue team via @ThaiRescueNews Facebook page)

SING BURI: Three Myanmar migrant workers were burned to death and eight others injured when a van they were travelling in caught fire after hitting a trailer truck in Phrom Buri district in the early hours of Saturday.

The fatal crash occurred at kilometre maker 77 on the Asia Highway 32 in tambon Ban Paeng, said Pol Col Phuriwat Piluek, a duty officer at Phrom Buri police station.

Police and rescue workers rushing to the scene after being alerted at around 3.30am found the charred wreckage of a van bearing a Bangkok licence plate some 100 metres from an 18-wheel trailer truck with a Sing Buri licence plate on the road.

Three passengers were burned beyond recognition and trapped in the wreckage of the van. They were Myanmar nationals -- one man and two women, Thai media reported.

Eight other Myanmar passengers, five of whom were men, were hurt and rushed to Phrom Buri Hospital.

Suranart Chansong, 34, told police that while he was driving the truck loaded with gypsum, the van travelling at a high speed suddenly rammed into the right side of his truck.

The force of the crash caused the van’s door to come off and all passengers on board were thrown out of the vehicle, said Mr Suranart, adding he stopped his truck and rushed to help them.

Ronnakorn Tonrap, the van driver, said the Myanmar migrant workers took his van from Bangkok to Chiang Rai. Some wanted to renew their visas while others were returning home.

When his van arrived at the spot, the trailer truck travelling ahead of his vehicle suddenly changed lanes and he was unable to avoid the crash, claimed the van driver.

The door on the passenger side hit the truck, causing it to fall down. The passengers were thrown out of the vehicle. The front right wheel dislodged before the van engulfed in flames, said Mr Ronnakorn.

He immediately left the van but was unable to rescue the three passengers as they were crushed and the fire spread quickly, said the driver.

Police took the two drivers to the police station for further interrogation. They were asked to undergo alcohol blood tests. The officers were investigating to find the cause of the crash.

Passa il tempo con il suo Israel, nato giovedì scorso, stretto al petto, sulla pelle nuda, per fargli sentire tutto il suo calore. È una pratica nata tanti anni fa, per i bambini prematuri, la chiamano «cura della mamma canguro». Perché questo lui dovrà essere per Israel: padre e madre.

Beauty, 31 anni Sua moglie Beauty è morta a 31 anni, subito dopo averlo dato alla luce, uccisa da un fibroma che non le ha dato scampo e di fronte al quale la Gendarmeria francese non ha avuto pietà: il 9 febbraio, gli agenti l’hanno respinta con il marito alla frontiera italiana mentre cercava di raggiungere Oltralpe la sorella su un pullman. L’hanno lasciata alla stazione di Bardonecchia, nella notte, nonostante il pancione di sei mesi e nonostante non riuscisse quasi a respirare per colpa di quel tumore conseguenza di una trasfusione sbagliata fatta in Nigeria.

Portata a Rivoli e poi a Torino I primi ad accorgersi di lei sono stati i medici di Rain-bow4Africa, guidati da Paolo Narcisi, che, da inizio dicembre, prestano soccorso ai migranti al confine. Beauty è stata portata subito a Rivoli, l’ospedale più grande della zona, ai piedi della Val di Susa. Poi, il trasferimento al Sant’Anna, presidio ginecologico di riferimento, dove i medici hanno provato a studiare una strategia. «La nostra priorità è salvare sempre mamma e bambino ma ci siamo chiesti se interrompere la gravidanza potesse essere utile», confida Tullia Todros, ginecologa responsabile del Servizio di gravidanze a rischio dell’ospedale. «Dato, però, che la signora voleva proteggere il suo piccolo, d’accordo con gli ematologi del dottor Umberto Vitolo abbiamo optato per la chemioterapia. È stato un tentativo, ma la mamma era ormai in fase terminale e giovedì scorso abbiamo praticato il taglio cesareo per salvare almeno il feto»."

For Rafael Luna, an immigrant from Mexico, the answer was simple: Find him.

Luna, 50, is one of the dozen or so people who reach out each day to Águilas del Desierto, or Eagles of the Desert, a group of volunteers who venture into some of the most forbidding stretches of the border with Mexico once a month to search for the bodies of migrants who die while making the crossing into the United States.

The organization was founded six years ago in San Diego by working people, mostly immigrants themselves, who saw a need to help families find some kind of closure. While illegal border crossings have plunged in recent years, the number of migrants dying along the border is climbing; more than 400 people were found dead in 2017.

With the Border Patrol pushing border crossers into more remote areas, and with a heat wave punishing parts of the Southwest, forensic researchers say the number of migrants dying around the border may actually be much higher, providing the Águilas with many grisly reports of such tragedies.

Sometimes the relatives of missing migrants accompany the Águilas on their grim task, as Luna did one recent Saturday, just an hour’s drive from prosperous San Diego. He joined more than 20 volunteers who piled into aging 4x4s and then fanned out on a stretch of barren federal land.

After trekking under the desert sun, using satellite images and intelligence gleaned from other migrants, they found the body of a man who seemed to have been trying to find shelter near a boulder in his last moments alive. Next to him, in a bag of belongings, was a Mexican ID card with the name of Adrian Luna, who went missing two months ago while crossing the border.

“That was my brother,” Luna said after absorbing the shock of finding the remains, and thanking the Águilas for their help in finding the body. He and the volunteers placed a simple wooden cross where the remains were found. “Now, maybe it’s time to move on,” he said."

The woman from Chitungwiza was found by police officers patrolling the area at around 4AM on Monday. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident.



He said the woman was identified as Nosiza Sibanda and her relatives have been notified.

“I can confirm that a 43-year-old woman was found dead along Limpopo River yesterday morning. It is suspected that a hippopotamus killed her while she was trying to illegally cross over to neighbouring South Africa,” said Insp Ndebele.





He said the woman was travelling from Harare where she was staying.

“Police officers discovered her body next to the bridge yesterday at around 4AM while doing patrols and no foul play is suspected,” Insp Ndebele said.





He said it is better for people to raise $53 to get a passport than risk their lives crossing the border at illegal points.





“We have always encouraged people to use proper channels as passports cost only $53. They would rather use passports than resort to illegal border jumping,” Insp Ndebele said.

He said there are crimes that take place at illegal crossing points in Beitbridge which members of the public should be wary of. “People are always robbed or even raped and we wish to warn people to stop putting their lives at risk,” said Insp Ndebele. Chronicle"

Nine people were rescued by the coast guard overnight, it said, adding that search and rescue efforts were continuing for one missing person after the incident off the coastal province of Ayvalik.

The boat was believed to be en route to Greece’s Lesvos island which is around 20 km (12 miles) away from the Turkish coast, it said.

From January to July this year at least 54 irregular migrants died trying to cross to Europe from Turkey, according to coast guard statistics.

According to a local official, the people who were trying to cross to the Greek island were Turkish citizens and two of them are believed to be illegal crossing organizers, Anadolu reported. [Reuters]"

This ruled out the possibility that it could have been one of the two children who went missing earlier this month with their mother after their boat capsized in the Evros.

The woman and one of her children were found dead, while a search for the other was unsuccessful."

On July 29, border surveillance cameras spotted a group of suspected illegal aliens attempting to cross into the United States illegally near Clint. Two people then jumped into deep, fast-moving currents of the irrigation canal. A Border Patrol Agent raced to the scene to find the two people struggling to stay afloat in the canal, just north of the pedestrian fence. The agent went into the water and was able to save one person, but the second subject went underwater and was not seen again.

Agents took three subjects from the group into custody. They told agents the missing person was from El Salvador, and did not know how to swim. Agents say the turbulent waters can make survival nearly impossible since currents can travel at a speed of up to 40-miles per-hour, and can be up to 15-feet deep.

Members of the Clint and San Elizario Fire and Rescues Units, along with other area law-enforcement personnel, continued the search for the lost subject. The victim was eventually found in the water and declared deceased. The body of the unidentified person was extracted by El Paso County authorities Monday afternoon.

This latest incident serves as a grim reminder of the many dangers faced by those who attempt to illegally cross the U.S./Mexico border in deserts and through area waterways. It also reflects the type of courage carried out by the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol on a daily basis as they continue to protect the lives of those they encounter along the southwest border."

Doctor Corinne Stern at the Webb County Morgue says she's seen 92 victims so far this year compared to 69 at the same time last year.

It's believed many of the deaths are due to the extreme temperatures in the area; whether it may be from the cold during the winter months or the heat over the summer.

The remains that cannot be identified are sent to the anthropology department at the University of North Texas.

Stern says the deaths of people crossing the border increases in mid-April and peaks in July and August.

""Any time I'm at the autopsy table I don't want to see anybody die. It's very sad and here we have young crossers, and especially during the cold these young people were not prepared. We had a 14-year-old, several seventeen year olds, nineteen year olds, they haven't even started their lives yet,"" she said. ""You know, and it is sad but part of this is education and the coyotes bringing these people across, their not educating them, their not preparing them for this journey. To them it's more dollars and cents, so they come across unprepared and that's how they end up on my autopsy table."""

El refugio del Hogar del Espírito Santo en Tunja se consolidó principalmente por la historia de una menor de cinco años que murió de hipotermia en el Páramo de Berlín ubicado en la vía que comunica Bucaramanga con Pamplona.

Iba con su abuela y otros caminantes y no soportó el frío por lo que fue enterrada en la carretera.

“Luego de esa historia nos hemos enterado de muchísimas más, incluso una madre que estaba alimentando a su bebé, ella y la niña murieron de un paro respiratorio, y así por encima que sepamos han muerto, creo, nueve niños y los demás han sido adultos. Es una historia muy fuerte y lo más triste es que sus familias no deben saber que murieron en el camino”, cuenta Anny.

Hace tres semanas, asegura, murieron tres jóvenes que hacían parte de un grupo de 17 personas, las 14 que salieron bien libradas llegaron al refugio.

Los caminantes que no lograron una “cola” o aventón llegan contando qué parte del cuerpo no sentían cuando pasaron, reconocen la advertencia que les hacen de no pasar después de las dos, pero dicen que tienen que seguir caminando porque el recorrido es largo, incluso pasan en la noche.

“Los señores que nos estaban asistiendo ahí nos dijeron que después de las 2 de la tarde no podíamos pasar porque nos podíamos caer en ‘La Nevera’ porque el hielo es muy terrible para nosotros. Nosotros nos percatamos y seguimos pero había una señora que iba con su hijo de seis meses. Cuando nos dimos cuenta a la señora se le había muerto el niño, ya venía muerto cuando pasamos el páramo”, cuenta un venezolano que más bien parece colombiano.

Casi todos los que pasan por el refugio tienen una historia parecida, como una venezolana que mientras está en él vende dulces pero para devolverse a Venezuela porque no ha conseguido trabajo:

UPDATE: Coast Guard suspends search for 3 missing migrants

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The Coast Guard suspended the search at 6:30 p.m. Thursday for three missing Dominican migrants near Rincon.



Search crews completed 16 searches covering more than 2,100 square miles.



""Suspending a search is one of my most difficult responsibilities,"" said Capt. Eric King, commander of Sector San Juan. ""I commend all the crews, including our partner agencies, who worked diligently, and through the night, to search for the missing men.""



The three Dominican men were last seen at 7 a.m. Wednesday wearing white disposable protective coveralls aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Richard Dixon (WPC-1113).

The cutter was transiting less than two miles from shore with 22 interdicted migrants aboard. The missing migrants were not wearing life jackets.

At 7:25 a.m. Wednesday Richard Dixon crew members noticed the three migrants missing. The crew contacted Coast Guard Sector San Juan and initiated a search.

On Monday, the Coast Guard Cutter Joseph Tezanos (WPC-1118) interdicted 27 migrants, including the missing men, aboard a disabled boat in the Mona Pass.

The body of Joseph was discovered around 06: 25 hrs by his relatives who were part of a search party. The discovery was made on the #63 beach foreshore in the vicinity of Number 60 village, East Berbice, Corentyne. Joseph was found lying face down on the beach and was clad in a purple short pants and a camouflage vest. Blood was seen in his ears, nose and mouth. None of his personal belongings were recovered, nor found in the area.

Recovered: Baboni Harihar, called “Doris”

The news of his death has taken a toll on the family as they, like the other families, were hoping to find the trio alive.

“Me nah been expect that at all… after he call say he a left and then me brother call and seh he reach; me expect to see him but never me expect wan news like this,” Narinee Shamsundar, a cousin whom Joseph was expected to stay with during his visit to Guyana, related.

Shamsundar said she only learnt late on Tuesday evening that Joseph made the special trip to visit her brother, whom they both grew up with. Her brother is very ill and hospitalised. The ill man is unaware his cousin died as relatives are fearful news of Joseph’s death may cause his condition to worsen.

The site where Harihar body was found

VERY SICK

“Me nah know he was coming to visit me brother, he very sick and his pressure is very high for the past three weeks; it nah go down and as them keep doing tests, is more complaints and sick them a find. So Alwin tell me seh he a come see he and now this morning he a ask where he cousin deh, that he come in Guyana Monday night but we nah tell him nothing because it go send he pressure more high, and we nah know what guh happen to he,” Shamsundar sobbed as she wiped the tears from her face.

Meanwhile, the body of 77-year-old Harihar, popularly called “Doris” was found by a fisherman some nine villages further up the Corentyne foreshore at #69 village as he was tending to his seine. According to police, the fisherman noticed a handbag nearby and upon further investigation, he saw the lifeless body of a female in a clump of mangroves and raised an alarm.

Harihar was discovered facing upward. She was clad in a black and red dress and the skin on her hands and feet were peeled. A small pocket of blood was found next to her body. A black and white Adidas haversack was also found nearby. It contained some clothing and a Guyana Identification Card for one Sookranie Harry. A short distance away, a travelling bag with a black purse was also found. In that bag, Harihar’s identification card was found.

Sharida Hussein

POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED

The body was taken to the Anthony’s Funeral Parlour at Epson Village where her grand-daughter, Nadira Valdez, was able to positively identify the remains as that of her grandmother.

Sunita Sukra, the daughter of Harihar, disclosed to the media that her mother left Guyana in December following calls from relatives here for her to visit her grandchildren in Suriname. She wanted to return home to see her great-grandchildren and was placed on board a boat owned by a relative and accompanied by another relative, along with two other passengers on Monday night. Sukra continued that they were unaware that her mother had left to come to Guyana and it was until a relative called to enquire if she reached home that they went to the Number 63 foreshore looking for her.

She disclosed that the relative on the boat told them that he left her along with the other two passengers on a sandbank and was unaware how far it was from shore.

“When me son-in-law ask me brother-in-law where really he drop off me mother, he said he drop them on a sea bank on the river over there and he didn’t realise that distance far away from the shore. He didn’t realise that the distance was suh far away and when he do check back, they were already gone,” the daughter related.

Up to press time, the relatives of Sherida Hussein were still combing the Corentyne foreshore hoping to find her.

On Monday evening, at around 19:00hrs, Hussain, Harihar and Joseph left Nickerie, Suriname, bound for Guyana in a speed boat. They were dropped off on a sandbank by the captain and a relative of Harihar in the vicinity of #63 Beach. From all indication, they were swept away by high tide in their attempt to make it safely to shore.

The bodies of Joseph and Harihar are awaiting an autopsy at the Anthony’s Funeral Parlor while the search continues for Hussein."

The Turkish migrant drowned attempting an illegal crossing into Croatia

The body of a Turkish citizen was discovered at the river Glina in northwestern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The citizen had been missing for days and it was sadly already suspected the Turkish migrant drowned after becoming separated from a group they were travelling with.

Seven Turkish migrants had attempted to illegally cross the border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia on the Glina River during the night of Thursday 11 February 2021 and the morning of Friday 12 February 2021. They believed the water level in the area was low. Alongside extremely cold temperatures, the nighttime darkness they used as a cover for the illegal border crossing attempt, must have made the journey treacherous. The tragic result is that one Turkish migrant drowned.

According to Svevlad Hoffman, advisor to the director of the BiH Border Police, six migrants were saved from drowning at the time of the crossing, but one of the group disappeared. This Turkish migrant drowned.

""It was suspected that there was a drowning, which was unfortunately confirmed today,"" Hoffman said. He explained that the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Croatia, whose members had found the Turkish migrant drowned, had informed them about the discovery of the body. Police from Bosnia and Herzegovina had informed Croatian counterparts about the situation at the time of the migrant's disappearance.

Investigation of the case was taken over by the State Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and six Turkish citizens were handed over to the jurisdiction of the Service for Foreigners Affairs of BiH.

The river Glina, where the Turkish migrant drowned, forms a natural border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the Croatian side of the border lie Karlovac County and Sisak-Moslavina County. On the Bosnian side of the border, many large camps have sprung up containing migrants who wish to attempt an illegal crossing into Croatia. Croatia is rarely their intended destination. Most are hoping to travel further west into the European Union."

Agents have rescued over 200 people so far in the course of their duties.

Big Bend Sector Border Patrol Agents have risked their own lives in the on-going effort to patrol the sector despite the winter weather. Agents have successfully rescued over 200 people in recent days from dangerous conditions in the area, saving life and limb. The massive winter storm blanketing the entire state of Texas has produced significant snow and prolonged freezing temperatures in West Texas between Sierra Blanca and Van Horn where the majority of the rescues have occurred. Besides rescues, one individual, who likely succumbed to the harsh environmental elements, has been recovered by Big Bend Sector agents and local law-enforcement. Approximately 10 people were admitted to regional hospitals for exposure, frostbite or more serious medical conditions.

Many people rescued by Big Bend Sector agents were found to have been abandoned by alien smugglers with some calling 911 operators seeking help or flagging down motorists as they reached area highways. Family members have reported their loved-ones missing to Border Patrol resulting in additional searches and lives saved. The rescued subjects were found to be present in the U.S. illegally with citizenship from numerous countries including Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico.

All subjects were processed according to Big Bend Sector protocols for appropriate adjudication. U.S. Customs and Border Protection remains vigilant regarding U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that COVID-19 is not further introduced into the United States.

She barely survived after Border Patrol Agents from Big Bend Sector were able to get her medical attention and evacuate her to a hospital for life threatening injuries.

Agents at the Van Horn, Texas Border Patrol Station were advised by a caller claiming to be a relative of a 43-year-old woman from Mexico that she was abandoned by a smuggler on Saturday, Feb. 13. Agents deployed to the area to look for the female subject with no initial success. Finally, a rancher in the local area notified Border Patrol Agents he encountered the female. Agents immediately responded to the ranch with emergency medical equipment and agents who are qualified as Emergency Medical Technicians. Agents performed first-aid to stabilize the subject and elevate her core body temperature to enable safe transport from the remote area of Texas to a regional hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia and severe frostbite.

The female subject notified agents that she spent three days hidden among rocks during the actual snowstorm. According to initial reports, she said that once the snow stopped falling, she made her way to an abandoned shed where she spent three additional days in freezing temperatures. On the sixth day she observed a dirt road that had fresh vehicle tracks and followed them until she came upon a rancher.

The unfortunate events that unfolded during this harrowing experience may last for a while as she tries to recover from her frostbite and its lingering effects. “It’s unfortunate so many people place their lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers, which often results in a tragic situation like this,” said Big Bend Sector Chief Patrol Agent Sean McGoffin. “For smugglers, it’s a business and they will leave you behind if you cannot keep up with them.”

Agents rescued over 200 people during the inclement weather, doing everything in their power to save the lives of those in need. Unfortunately, four subjects succumbed to the cold weather before they were found by agents. “For us, it’s about a precious life lost,” said Chief McGoffin. “Our greatest concern is the preservation of life. Our agents go well beyond the normal requirements of the job to help others. They know in these situations, there are no second chances.”

After receiving extensive medical treatment, the female subject was processed according to Big Bend Sector protocols for appropriate adjudication. U.S. Customs and Border Protection remains vigilant regarding U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that COVID-19 is not further introduced into the United States.

di Mauro Seminara

La Asso Trenta, cargo italiano di supporto logistico alla piattaforma petrolifera Bouri, è arrivata a Porto Empedocle stamattina con 232 migranti a bordo; dopo una insolita rotta che l’ha spinta fino a nord di Malta per un lungo ritorno davanti il porto in provincia di Agrigento. Porto assegnato già quando il cargo aveva impostato rotta nordest, come per dirigersi verso Pozzallo o Augusta, sulla costa est della Sicilia. All’alba l’ingresso in porto. Una notte in più in attesa di sbarco per una nave transitata ieri mattina da Lampedusa e diretta al largo di Pozzallo invece che direttamente nel porto in provincia di Agrigento, cui si è però aggiunta anche una giornata di attesa in banchina. Dodici ore circa dopo l’arrivo della nave erano scesi soltanto quattro emergenze sanitarie ed il cadavere che la Asso Trenta aveva a bordo. Gli altri, i naufraghi che ancora si reggevano in piedi, attendevano i tamponi per il Covid-19 prima di poter scendere a terra, anche se per poi risalire su altra nave. La Asso Trenta si trova infatti ormeggiata lungo la banchina condivisa dalla nave quarantena GNV Allegra, destinazione per i prossimi giorni delle persone soccorse al largo della Libia dal cargo battente bandiera italiana.

Lo sbarco del cadavere dalla Asso Trenta con il carro funebre (sulla destra) pronto in banchina a Porto Empedocle il pomeriggio del 22 febbraio 2021

La Asso Trenta non è l’unico cargo intervenuto su una scena drammatica che sempre più inconfutabilmente dimostra come la Libia non sia in grado di gestire la sconfinata area SAR, cioè di responsabilità per ricerca e soccorso, che l’IMO (agenzia delle Nazioni Unite) ha ritenuto di poterle affidare malgrado i report delle stesse Nazioni Unite sull’indisponibilità – requisito fondamentale per l’assegnazione di SAR zone – di place of safety, porti sicuri in cui poter sbarcare naufraghi dopo un soccorso marittimo. Infatti, i cargo coinvolti su un evento sono due per la compagnia italiana, la Asso Ventinove e la Asso Trenta. Dopo il duplice soccorso, pare di circa 120 persone sulla prima ed il resto sulla seconda, qualcuno – teoricamente dovrebbe essere stata la Guardia Costiera italiana che gestisce la Centrale di Coordinamento Soccorso Marittimo (IMRCC) italiana – ha autorizzato il trasbordo al largo tra le due navi Asso per risolvere la distrazione dai propri servizi di entrambi i cargo e distoglierne pertanto soltanto uno. Appunto, la Asso Trenta. Nelle stesse ore, poco distante dalla piattaforma petrolifera offshore su cui operano le Asso, esattamente tra la Bouri e la Farwah, un cargo di analoghe mansioni ma di altra bandiera interveniva su un altro naufragio.

Ambulanza disposta sulla banchina di Porto Empedocle per le evacuazioni mediche dalla Asso Trenta il pomeriggio del 22 febbraio 2021

La Vos Triton, battente bandiera di Gibilterra, opera analogamente alle Asso, sulla piattaforma petrolifera della francese Total. Il cargo prende a bordo 77 persone, superstiti, ed un cadavere. Una vittima sul Vos Triton dell’affidabile partner italiano che ha forse l’area SAR più sconfinata del Mar Mediterraneo e che con motovedette, assistenza, manutenzione e formazione italiana dovrebbe evitare che le persone muoiano in mare oltre a “contenere” le partenze di migranti verso l’Italia. Sul natante naufragato per il quale è intervenuto il cargo Vos Triton pare ci fossero circa 120 persone. Facendo un rapido conto dei cadaveri che sbarcano in Italia e dei dispersi, si potrebbe anche dire che in qualche modo l’arrivo di profughi in Italia viene anche contenuto. Dal naufragio a 15 miglia sud di Lampedusa – in cui risultano disperse almeno sette persone – sono trascorsi giusto un paio di giorni oggi Una settimana dal precedente naufragio nel Mediterraneo centrale, sempre di migranti respinti dalle vie legali, in cui a perdere la vita sono state 23 persone (sul momento un morto e 22 dispersi ad oggi non ritrovati). .

Naufraghi a bordo della Asso Trenta nel porto di Porto Empedocle

La Vos Triton arriva in un momento di evidente confusione nazionale italiana, con un nuovo Governo – che in parte sembra non essere mai stato tanto vecchio – e nel pieno del giro di valzer per la nomina dei sottosegretari. In questo frangente di distrazione politica, il cargo viene autorizzato al porto sicuro più vicino che, non trattandosi di navi Ong, è evidentemente l’Italia. Nessun dubbio questa volta per il cargo che della compagnia Vroon che nel marzo del 2019 soccorse 54 naufraghi respingendoli in Libia. Qualche dubbio invece il cargo battente bandiera di Gibilterra pare lo abbia avuto sull’esatto porto italiano in cui sbarcare i naufraghi ed il cadavere – che dalle foto diffuse da Sea Watch sembrerebbe essere di un ragazzo o un bambino – visto che la Vos Triton si era spostata su Lampedusa per attendervi una intera notte e qualche ora in più prima di ricevere altri ordini e riprendere la navigazione verso Porto Empedocle. Attendiamo conferma su alcune evacuazioni mediche effettuate su Lampedusa per emergenze sanitarie, ma pare non ci siano dubbi sulla destinazione del cadavere che anche questo cargo ha a bordo e che ancora questa sera attende in rada davanti il porto di Porto Empedocle il proprio turno di sbarco.

Asso Trenta e GNV Allegra ormeggiate a Porto Empedocle

Sembra la macabra danza di navi cargo carichi di morte e disperazione, ma anche delle navi quarantena che passeggiano avanti e indietro secondo gli umori del responsabile logistico di turno presso il Viminale. La GNV Allegra, che si trovava già a Porto Empedocle ed aveva preso a bordo persone soccorse e sbarcate dalla nave Ong catalana Open Arms cui era stato indicato il porto agrigentino mentre una violenta burrasca la costringeva a navigare a due o tre nodi, dopo l’imbarco di migranti fino a raggiungimento del numero massimo previsto a bordo, si sposterà al largo per cedere il posto alla SNAV Adriatico. Quest’ultima è stata destinata a Porto Empedocle dopo giorni vani al largo di Lampedusa. Nel frattempo, la maggiore delle Pelagie era stata raggiunta dall’ultima delle navi quarantena entrate in faraonico – per le tasche dei contribuenti – servizio sanitario, la GNV Splendid. .

Quest’ultima è stata destinata a Porto Empedocle dopo giorni vani al largo di Lampedusa.

La GNV Splendid, l’ultima delle navi quarantena entrate in servizio, ferma in rada a Lampedusa il 21 febbraio 2021

Anche la Splendid però è rimasta al palo, o all’ancora, a Lampedusa senza poter procedere con imbarchi causa avverse condizioni meteo, almeno per lo scalo alternativo di Cala Pisana, sul lato est di Lampedusa. Dal centro di accoglienza dell’isola però qualcuno è stato trasferito comunque, senza quarantena e senza problemi meteo. Per ridimensionare il sovraffollamento di quello che venne definito “Hotspot” perché doveva essere il punto di redistribuzione europea dei richiedenti asilo, cosa mai avvenuta, le persone migranti sono state trasferite a mezzo nave traghetto di linea verso Porto Empedocle. Chiaramente, visto il servizio privato in regime di continuità territoriale dei traghetti Cossyra e Sansovino che collegano le Pelagie a Porto Empedocle, si può supporre che con due navi quarantena – da un milione di euro al mese ciascuna – ferme in rada, siano stati pagati i biglietti per le centinaia di migranti trasferiti da Lampedusa ed anche per gli agenti di scorta.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Eight people in a pickup truck loaded with immigrants were killed when the vehicle crashed into another truck during a police chase that began when the driver refused to pull over for a traffic violation near the Texas border city of Del Rio, authorities said.

The collision happened weeks after one of the deadliest highway crashes involving migrants entering the U.S. without permission and amid rising crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Texas Department of Public Safety says troopers were chasing a red Dodge pickup truck on U.S. Highway 277 on Monday afternoon when the truck collided head-on with a white Ford F-150 nearly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Del Rio.

The driver and a child passenger of the Ford F-150 were hospitalized, as was one of the passengers from the Dodge pickup, according to the agency’s statement. All eight of the people killed and the surviving passenger of the Dodge pickup were immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, according to DPS.

In a statement Tuesday, the agency did not specify what type of traffic violation occurred that prompted patrol troopers to pursue the Dodge pickup.

The people killed were all Mexican nationals between the ages of 18 and 20, according to Val Verde County Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez. He said seven were men and one was a woman.

Martinez referred other questions to DPS.

The driver of the Dodge pickup truck, Sebastian Tovar, 24, ran away following the crash, but was later arrested, according to the state agency. A DPS spokesperson said Tovar was booked into federal custody and additional state charges were pending.

Earlier this month, 13 people were killed in a crash shortly after a Ford Expedition entered California through a section of border fence with Mexico that was cut away, apparently by smugglers, according to immigration officials. The Expedition crammed with 25 people struck a tractor-trailer.

In a statement Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas conceded that a recent increase in children traveling alone across the Mexican border was a challenge. He noted that the number of Border Patrol encounters at the border has been steadily increasing since last April. But, he added, “This is not new,” citing previous surges in border crossings in 2019 and 2014.

They were directly left to the sea without any lifeboat or inflatable boat. They were 7 people in total. SAR operations continued for the purpose of finding 1 missing person. On 21 March 2021 at 16.25, the missing migrant was detected as alive and rescued and delivered to 112 Emergensy Service Ambulance staff at Çeşme Port."

WASHINGTON: Businessman Bahaa Hariri welcomed a $10 million US bounty for Hezbollah fugitive Salim Ayyash who was convicted for assassinating his father Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

Bahaa, the eldest son of Rafik, told Arab News that he has confidence in the international justice system.

“I welcome the imitative by the President’s Biden administration to offer a bounty of $10 million in exchange of information on the whereabouts of Salim Ayyash,” he said.

The State Department said it would offer the reward for “information leading to the location or identification” of Salim Ayyash or “information leading to preventing him from engaging in an act of international terrorism against a US person or US property.”

Set up by the United Nations in The Netherlands, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in December convicted Ayyash in absentia to life in prison over the killing of Hariri in 2005.

Ayyash, 57, is believed to be in hiding in Lebanon where Hezbollah’s chief Hassan Nasrallah has refused to hand him over.

The tribunal has since said it will also try Ayyash over three other attacks on Lebanese politicians in the mid-2000s.

The State Department said that Ayyash has also plotted to harm US military personnel.

Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, was allegedly killed because he opposed Lebanon’s control by Syria, which is allied with Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim movement backed by Iran.

The assassination sparked the Cedar Revolution which forced out Syrian troops.

The United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist group but the movement wields political power in Lebanon, holding seats in parliament.

Location of the shipwreck in the making. Image: Alarm Phone.

Again, we are witnessing how the so called Libyan Coastguard fails in saving lives

Today, at 08.00h CEST, the Alarm Phone was alerted by ~85 people on board a rubber boat in severe distress just a few nautical miles off the Libyan coast. The people told us that part of the boat was deflated, and that 2 women and 3 children had gone overboard and drowned.

We immediately informed all authorities about the urgent distress situation via email.

At 8:29h, the boat was at the following GPS position: N32.888669°, E012.51387°. At this point the boat had already been drifting the whole the night, just 5 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. During the next hours, the people in distress reported that more and more water was entering the boat.

Since 9:30h, we have been trying to reach the so-called Libyan coastguard on seven different telephone numbers – without any success: we also contacted MRCC Rome and RCC Malta, who either told us they were not responsible for the area, or did not pick up the phone. At 10:50, we again sent an updated GPS position to the authorities (N32.9131° E012.51409°), again without answer.

At this point, we were calling the Libyan coastguard on nine different telephone numbers. Only at 11:52, one of the numbers got through, and the so-called Coastguard told us that an asset was going in the direction of the distress case, but they were not able to tell us more. At 12:48, the so-called Libyan coastguard confirmed they had sent a Rhib, but had lost contact to their own asset. At 13:03 we again received an updated position from the people in distress (N32.91569°, E012.51932°), which we immediatly forwarded to authorities. The people on the boat also start calling the coastguard themselves, demanding to be rescued, and only received vague replies. We continued calling the Libyan Coastguard on nine different numbers. The few times they picked up, the “officer” only spoke Arabic, although according to the SAR convention any MRCC should be able to communicate in English.

At 16:12 CEST, a Libyan officer wrote down the latest GPS position and told us they will try to see whether they are able to send a rescue boat, but would only confirm after one hour. At 17:01 we received the last GPS position from the people in distress (N32.8724°, E012.45297°), and they reported that water was coming into the boat very quickly. The whole time the people were not moving, besides a bit of drifting, which means that “authorities” knew their location at every moment. Since then, we tried to continuously call the so-called Libyan coastguard, without success. Our last contact with the people in distress was at 18:39, and we have not been able to reach them anymore ever since. They might be drowning right now.

As several times before, we are now witnessing how the so-called Libyan Coastguard is very fast in intercepting and capturing moving boats fleeing Libya, as ordered by the EU-states, but only to force them back to Libya, where they suffer inhumane and often deadly conditions. The European border regime claims to be humanitarian, but it is not. It is very clear that they pay the so called Libyan Coastguard to prevent people to reach European soil, even if this comes at the cost of human lives.

We hope that at least some of the ~85 people will finally be rescued – many hours after our alert. Even if some will hopefully survive their flight attempt, many were left to die during hours of deliberate non-assistance. This is yet another example of the complete unwillingness of the so-called Libyan Coastguard to save lives. This is not by accident or by lack of resources, but by design: it is the very deliberate consequence of the deadly migration regime that is building and financing them.

The Alarm Phone has been publishing updates about this shipwreck in the making since the early morning hours and is reporting live updates about humans drowning in front of the very eyes of the European public. Nobody can claim not to be informed or to not be aware of what is happening to migrants fleeing via Libya to search for a better life – day by day.

The European states praise the so called Libyan Coastguard for their efforts to save lives, knowing very well that they do the exact opposite: they are the European tool to keep people on the move outside Europe, and to let them die.

We will hold them accountable for every single life they take.

Abolish the so called Libyan Coastguard and destroy the European border regime!"

On Thursday, 18 March 2021, a tragedy unfolded off the Libyan coast. Survivors report that about 60 people went missing and are presumed dead after their boat engine caught on fire.

02.30am CET, a grey wooden boat with more than 100 people on board called Alarm Phone. The people on the phone were in panic, as their engine was on fire. Alarm Phone alerted relevant authorities as well as the Ocean Viking and requested an immediate search for the boat in distress. The rescue vessel Ocean Viking started a search operation. Unfortunately, the people in distress were at first unable to provide an accurate GPS position. Only at approximately 08.00am were we able to obtain a reliable position of the Ata grey wooden boat with more than 100 people on board called Alarm Phone. The people on the phone were in panic, as their engine was on fire. Alarm Phone alerted relevant authorities as well as the Ocean Viking and requested an immediate search for the boat in distress. The rescue vessel Ocean Viking started a search operation. Unfortunately, the people in distress were at first unable to provide an accurate GPS position. Only at approximatelywere we able to obtain a reliable position of the boat in distress

The Libyan authorities later reported that the boat was found and that 45 people had been rescued while five bodies were retrieved. The Libyan authorities mention no further deaths. However, several survivors reported to Alarm Phone that there had been more victims than survivors. According to the testimonies we have collected, about 45 people were rescued by fishermen but about 60 people are still missing and presumed dead. 60 people killed by the EU border regime. In silence. In order to break this silence, we provide several witness testimonies in this report.

Survivors know that their testimonies will not bring back their friends, but they bravely speak up after these tragedies to counter the lies and silence of authorities, and to document the violence that Europe seeks to hide by making these deaths invisible.

Besides survivors, also several relatives got in touch with Alarm Phone to ask for answers. They told us they had tried to call the Italian authorities for information on what happened to their loved ones, but have not received any information. They say: “We want to know what happened and the whole truth. What did authorities do to search for the missing.”

In what follows, we report some of the testimonies we have collected as well as a detailed timeline of the events for relatives to know what happened. We request authorities to provide a detailed report of the actions they have undertaken to search and rescue the people in distress, to search for the missing and for the bodies of the dead, and to answer any open question around the unfolding of the events during and after the rescue operation conducted by fishermen.

Survivors’ Testimonies

First testimony

We were more than 130 people, most of them young people from Sudan and Senegal, four people from Syria, two from Pakistan and seven Moroccans, and with us about four Egyptians, and we also had children and women. The wooden boat, was large and consisted of two floors and a length of 12 meters. The smuggler warned us strongly that no one should light a cigarette on a boat. We went and pushed the boat to the sea. I was afraid of the strength of the waves, the waves were very high. I was waiting for my turn to go up on a boat and I was taking time to avoid descending to the lower floor. But then they told us that the boat was full. About 35 people could not be embarked. We were psychologically devastated, disappointed and very desperate. I returned sadly to the waiting location and we could not sleep all night. At about ten o’clock in the morning we heard shocking news that part of the boat was burned and many people lost their lives and the rest of the survivors were returned to a port by a fisherman, and now many of them are in a hospital affected by the fire. The rest of the people came back to our site and said that the total of the survivors were 49 people, and they were more than 110 people on board, which means the missing were more than the survivors. The number of missing persons is 60 people or more, who went missing because of the fire. The reason for the disaster is because the captain of the boat used a lighter to see the engine, and the fuel went on fire. He and everyone sitting next to a captain and a part of them went into the water due to a burning fire and could not return to a boat because they did not have the necessary safety means. The Libyan fishermen rescued them, but they did not search for the missing people.

Second testimony

The wooden boat was on two levels. That captain made a mistake, how does one think of using a lighter in order to see the gasoline? At the time when the fire was set off from the engine, all those who were sitting by the engine went down in the water, as a fire started with the very flammable gasoline. And those who were in the upper level did not go down, but pulled off their clothes, and the fire was put off. We were rescued by the fishermen, but the police were nearby them and took them to prison and they were later released.

Third testimony

I was in direct contact with Alarm Phone from the boat. There were more than 100 people on the boat, and we lost at least 50 people. There was a fire and many people jumped into the water. I also jumped into the water, and I survived because I managed to swim back to the boat afterwards. We called the Italian authorities at least 20 times. Last time we asked them for the number of the Libyan Coastguard, but they refused to give it to us. I want to give you my detailed testimony.

(We promised we would call back but unfortunately the number was not registered).

DETAILED TIMELINE OF EVENTS

At 02.30h CET on 18 March 2021, a grey wooden boat with more than 100 people on board called Alarm Phone. The people on the phone were in panic, as their engine was on fire. They said they had left from Zuwara just a couple of hours earlier, and as they were calling from their mobile phones, the boat seemed to be very close to the Libyan shore.

We immediately tried to call the so-called Libyan coastguard, to mobilise quick intervention and rescue of the people in distress. As usual, nobody answered. We then immediately called both MRCC Rome and RCC Malta to inform them of the events and to ask their cooperation in ensuring a quick rescue. But both these authorities interrupted the calls and our later calls were not answered.

At 03:32h, we sent an email to the so-called Libyan Coastguard, MRCC Rome and MRCC Malta, informing them of the distress case. Unfortunately, at the time, we could not relay a GPS position of the people in distress as they were in such great panic that obtaining such information was not possible. However, we kept in contact with the people in distress, and following their request, we sent them the phone number of the Italian MRCC, which they said they tried to call several times but in vain.

At 04:57h, Alarm Phone finally managed to receive a GPS position of the people in distress (N33°35, E12°12, showing them in international waters, 50 nautical miles north-east of Zuwara. The people reported to us that 50 people had died due to a fire on board. We immediately forwarded the GPS position to all authorities and to Ocean Viking, who launched a search operation, moving toward the indicated position. Unfortunately, the boat was not found as the position shared by the people in distress was incorrect. When people are in severe distress, and communication is difficult, sharing their position by reading out the numbers aloud often leads to mistaken positions.

07:53h (in position N33.325°, E012.136°) In the meanwhile, the so-called Libyan Coastguard GACS patrol vessel P-301 demanded the assistance of the Ocean Viking for rescuing 10 people in distress on a fiberglass boat , which were safely taken on board the Ocean Viking at(in position N33.325°, E012.136°)

It is only at 08:00h that we managed to reach the people in distress again, and to receive a new GPS position that seemed to match their departure time. The new position 33°07 12°20 (08.10h) showed the boat just a few nautical miles from the coast, in the area between international waters and Libyan national waters.

According to Ocean Viking’s logbook the so-called Libyan Coastguard GACS patrol vessel P-301 had informed Ocean Viking that they would be heading towards the reported position. Ocean Viking followed, ready to provide assistance.

At 08.50h, the Frontex air surveillance aircraft Osprey1 could be tracked searching for the boat in distress around the position reported by Alarm Phone.

Photo: Screenshot of Osprey track at 08.50 CET.

Alarm Phone requested further information on that search mission from FRONTEX – no answer so far.

At 09:12h, according to the Ocean Viking logbook, both the Libyan Coastguard patrol vessel P-301 and Sea-Watch’s Seabird airplane, reported that the boat could not be found in the last position reported by Alarm Phone. Ocean Viking was then instructed to stop moving towards Libyan national waters and to head north, in a communication by the so-called Libyan coastguard patrol vessel 658.

At 10:03h, we managed to re-establish contact with the people in distress, but there was a lot of shouting and screaming in the background and the call got interrupted.

At 12.00h, the so-called Libyan coastguard informed both Alarm Phone and Ocean Viking that a shipwrecked boat had been intercepted in position 33°04’N 012°12’E (9 NM Northeast of Zuwara, Libya, in Libyan territorial waters). The so-called Libyan coastguard reported that 45 people had been intercepted and 5 people were reportedly dead.

However, soon after, Alarm Phone started receiving calls from the people who had been returned to land, who reported that about 45 people had been rescued by a fisherman whilst between 50 and 60 people went missing. They also reported that several people had severe fire burns, and that some people had been detained by the police and then released."

YCSO deputies and Border Patrol Agents (BPAs), including members of the Border Patrol’s Search and Rescue team as well as a BPA aboard an Arizona National Guard helicopter, responded to the area. Personnel aboard the helicopter located the individuals and guided in BPAs on the ground.

The female was reportedly located in the same area as her cousin and one other male. The two survivors told investigators that she became ill while crossing the desert and they were abandoned by the smuggler who was guiding them. The two survivors stated female was deceased for hours prior to being found by the BPAs. Investigators were also informed the group had been walking in the desert since entering the United States several days earlier. Both survivors declined medical assistance and were taken into Border Patrol custody.

The incident took place in a brushy area north of the Rio Grande, just south of Carrizo Springs, Texas, officials with Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) revealed to Breitbart Texas. Authorities in the U.S., including Border Patrol and local law enforcement, responded to the scene to assess the woman and then transported her to Eagle Pass for various legal procedures.

Mexico’s Consular officials responded to Eagle Pass to help identify the woman and contact next of kin. Breitbart Texas spoke with a consular official who identified the woman only as a 27-year-old from the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. The deceased migrant is the 24th migrant to die in the border areas between Eagle Pass, Texas, and Piedras Negras, Coahuila. The fatalities this year in that area are largely linked to migrants trying to cross the Rio Grande. As the summer months approach, the number of similar cases is expected to rise.

As Breitbart Texas reported , the Texas border is seeing a dramatic increase in migrant apprehensions, which have rapidly overwhelmed the detention and enforcement capabilities of the Department of Homeland Security. The most recent figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection point to a 450 percent increase from March 2020 to March 2021."

MEXICALI, B.C. (KYMA, KECY) -The deaths of undocumented immigrants attempting to cross the southern border continues to increase.

The All-American Canal is the most dangerous way they face. The most recent death was on March 22, totaling 16 deaths through the border.

The Consul of Mexico in Calexico, Ricardo Tarcisio Navarrete, says it found the man's body passed trapped in the canal near Holtville.

He adds the man was around 35 years old and was reported missing by his family in early March. Navarrete says most of the undocumented immigrants are found on the canal near the Holtville area.

Compared to last year, deaths keep increasing. Consulate officials continue to call on people not to risk their lives when crossing the border, especially in this weather."

Geneva - The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, are deeply saddened by the latest loss of at least two lives after a boat capsized off Venezuela’s shores on Thursday 22 April.

According to local authorities, at least 24 people including several children are believed to have been on board the boat heading towards the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Seven people were rescued by commercial Venezuelan vessels, and two bodies have so far been recovered, while rescue operations are ongoing to find other survivors among the 15 Venezuelans that are still unaccounted for according to authorities.

“The waters of the Caribbean Sea continue to claim the lives of Venezuelans,” said Eduardo Stein, Joint Special Representative of UNHCR and IOM for Venezuelan Refugees and Migrants. “As the conditions in the country continue to deteriorate – all worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic – people continue to undertake life-threatening journeys.”

This is the latest of several incidents involving the capsizing of boats carrying Venezuelan refugees and migrants towards Caribbean islands, the most recent reported near the Venezuelan city of Guiria in December last year.

With land and maritime borders still closed to limit COVID-19 transmission, these journeys take place mainly through irregular routes, heightening the dangers as well as health and protection risks.

“Shipwrecks, tragic deaths at border crossings and further suffering are avoidable, but only if immediate and concerted international action is mobilized to find pragmatic solutions that put saving lives and protecting human rights at the forefront of any response,” added Stein.

“The establishment of regular and safe pathways, including through humanitarian visas and family reunification, as well as the implementation of protection-sensitive entry systems and adequate reception mechanisms, can prevent the use of irregular routes, smuggling and trafficking.”

UNHCR and IOM reiterate their readiness to lend support and technical expertise in exploring practical solutions to provide regular pathways that also take into account COVID-19 prevention measures. UNHCR and IOM, as co-leaders of the Interagency Coordination Platform for refugees and migrants from Venezuela (R4V), work with at least 24 other partners and governments across the Caribbean to meet the needs of refugees and migrants in the sub-region.

There are over 5 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants around the world, 200,000 of whom are estimated to be hosted in the Caribbean.

CAIRO (AP) — As the waves pounded the gray rubber boat carrying more than 100 Africans hoping to reach Europe from Libya, those aboard dialed the number for migrants in distress frantically. In the series of calls to the Alarm Phone hotline, passengers explained that the dinghy had run out of fuel while trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea and was filling up with water and panic.

On the other end of the line, activists relayed the boat’s GPS coordinates repeatedly to Italian, Maltese and Libyan authorities and later to Frontex, the European Union’s border and coast guard agency, hoping authorities would launch a rescue operation as required under international maritime law.

An analysis of the logs and emails from Alarm Phone and the NGO SOS Mediterranée as well as reports by the Libyan coast guard show that the national authorities contacted responded slowly, insufficiently or not at all to the pleas for help. In all, approximately 130 people are believed to have died between April 21 and April 22 as they waited in vain for someone to save them, roughly 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the Libyan coast.

It was the deadliest wreck so far this year in the Mediterranean Sea, where more than 20,000 migrants or asylum seekers have perished since 2014, and has renewed accusations that European countries are failing to sufficiently help migrant boats in trouble.

Instead, human rights groups and the U.N.’s migration and refugee agencies and international law experts say European countries too often ignore their international obligations to rescue migrants at sea and outsource operations to the Libyan coast guard despite its limited capacity, reports of its ties to human traffickers, and the fact that those intercepted, including children, are placed in squalid, overcrowded detention centers where they face abuse, torture, rape and even death.

European nations, of course, routinely rescue migrants in distress. But no such rescue came on April 21.

Mubarak Jaber, who went to Libya to look for a job a year and a half ago, was among those who died in that wreck, according to his cousin, Mutawakel Ali, who just missed the boat himself. Jaber, 23, worked in construction, but struggled to send enough money back to his relatives in Sudan, so he contacted smugglers and boarded the migrant boat.

The rescue and coordination centers of Libya, Italy and Malta were first alerted that the boat needed help at 9:52 a.m. Central European Summer Time the next day, according to emails seen by The Associated Press.

Alarm Phone and SOS Mediterranée say they never received any response from Maltese authorities. The Armed Forces of Malta, responsible for maritime search-and-rescue operations, did not respond to several requests for comment from the AP.

It was only at 2:11 p.m., more than four hours later, that Alarm Phone received a response from Italian authorities, asking the activists to inform the “competent authorities” without specifying who those were.

Alarm Phone was only able to reach a Libyan officer nearly five hours after the first alert, at 2:44 p.m. They were told that the Libyan coast guard was indeed searching for three boats in the area — but with only one vessel.

A day after the wreck, Libyan coast guard spokesman Masoud Ibrahim Masoud told the AP that his agency found 106 migrants and two bodies from two other boats. Due to worsening weather and the poor health of those already found, they returned to port before locating the third boat, he said, adding that the support received from the EU was insufficient.

Frontex, which only patrols the Mediterranean by air, said it deployed two planes to look for the boat after being requested to do so by the Italians.

“Frontex did exactly what it had to do and above and beyond,” the agency’s spokesperson Chris Borowski told AP on April 24. “We alerted national rescue centers, we issued a mayday call to any vessel in the area to come to the rescue, and we stayed there as long as we could.”

But that mayday message was only sent at 7:15 p.m. according to SOS Mediterranée, more than nine hours after Italian, Maltese and Libyan authorities were first alerted. It is unclear why those three rescue and coordination centers did not issue an alert to vessels in the region sooner.

Frontex blamed the deaths on smugglers and deteriorating weather. On the night of April 21, waves reached 2 to 3 meters (6 1/2 to 10 feet) high.

Questioned by the AP about its role, the Italian coast guard referred back to a statement issued following the migrant deaths, saying the Libyans were responsible for the area where the boat got into trouble and coordinated the operation.

Setena Abdalla sobbed as she spoke from her home in Omdurman, Sudan, about the death of her only son: 24-year-old Mohammed Abdel-Khaliq.

“He was my whole life,” said the 54-year-old single mother.

Abdel-Khaliq had already attempted the crossing once before but was intercepted. He was determined to try again. On April 19, he phoned his mother for the last time.

A day later, he boarded a boat and now remains forever in the Mediterranean Sea.

Mohamed Zikri, a defence ministry spokesperson, said 33 survivors of the shipwreck were picked up after clinging to an oil platform off the southern coast of Tunisia.

“There are 33 survivors, all apparently from Bangladesh ,” Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), told AFP. “At least 50 are missing.”

The boat, crammed with more than 90 passengers, left the Libyan port of Zuwara on Sunday.

It was not immediately clear what caused the boat to sink, but vessels leaving the north African coast for Europe are often heavily overloaded makeshift crafts, departing at night even in rough weather to avoid detection from the coastguard.

Tunisian rescuers were bringing the survivors to the port of Zarzis, 100km (70 miles) north-west of Zuwara. “We don’t know the nationality of the more than 50 who are missing,” Di Giacomo added.

At least 1,200 migrants died in the Mediterranean last year, most of them crossing the central part of the sea, according to the United Nations.

Libya is a key gateway for Europe-bound migrants. According to the IOM, a Geneva-based UN agency, more than 500 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea from the shores of north Africa to Italy and Malta since the start of 2021.

On Monday, the Tunisian navy said it had rescued more than 100 migrants, mainly from Bangladesh and Sudan, whose boat was “on the verge of sinking”.

Several boats were also stopped by Libyan coastguards and brought back to shore overnight Sunday.

“Two days ago about 680 migrants were intercepted at sea and returned to Libya,” Di Giacomo said. “Almost 9,000 have been intercepted at sea and returned to Libya in 2021 so far.”

Safa Msehli of the IOM said support for search and rescue teams “should be contingent on no one being arbitrarily detained or subjected to human rights violations”, warning that “without such guarantees, such support should be reconsidered”."
North America,2021-05-12,1.0,,1,12.0,,1.0,,Haiti,Central America,Drowning,United States of America,Caribbean to US,"Remains found 40 yards off Jupiter Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida, USA",https://archive.ph/XcVM8,3,"Legal authorities are investigating an attempted migrant landing involving a 28-foot boat in Jupiter Beach, Florida.

Authorities found 13 undocumented Haitian migrants connected to the suspected smuggling vessel. One of the migrants was found dead and floating in the water nearby, according to WPFB. It's not yet clear how or when they died.

The vessel was first spotted on Wednesday near midnight. It appeared 40 yards offshore near the Jupiter Reef Club, an oceanfront property, WPTV reported.

Three Haitian men jumped overboard as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials approached the vessel. Though CPB apprehended all 12 living migrants, they reportedly questioned two of them for further information.

The boat remains on Jupiter Beach, according to WPEC. The beach is located 16 miles north of Palm Beach, a popular vacation destination. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, CBP, Jupiter police and the Department of Homeland Security are all investigating.

Newsweek contacted the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for comment.

Legal and immigration authorities in Florida are investigating the arrival of a boat that contained migrants. The vessel is thought to have carried 12 migrants and possible a 13th found dead on the beach.

The incident marks the second time this month and the fifth time this year that authorities have discovered a vessel smuggling Haitian migrants in Florida.

On May 3, CBP officials arrested 29 Haitians whose vessel landed near Hallandale Beach, a beach 15 miles north of Miami Beach. That incident involved a 45-foot sport-fishing vessel that made a distress call to the U.S. Coast Guard as it ran aground. The vessel began leaking diesel fuel into the ocean. It was later removed from the beach and seized by authorities, according to The Palm Beach Post.

On March 25, police apprehended 25 migrants who came ashore near South Palm Beach just after midnight. The group had five children including two 9-year-old girls, an infant boy, a 17-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl, the Post reported.

On March 3, authorities apprehended 25 Haitian migrants after their vessel began sinking 30 miles offshore. The group included nine men, nine women and seven children, the Post reported. The vessel used its onboard radio to call for help, but it lacked any other lifesaving equipment, authorities said.

On January 21, a group of 19 Haitians—including men, women and children—landed near the Boynton Beach waterfront park. The boat carrying the migrants departed soon after dropping its passengers on the beach. Authorities apprehended the migrants.

Haitians have increasingly migrated to the U.S. as well as other Caribbean and South and Central American countries, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). Political instability, widespread poverty and natural disasters have prompted the migration.

The Haitian immigrant population in the U.S. has grown from 92,000 in 1980 to 687,000 in 2018, MPI reported."

The incident is one of at least four at-sea human smuggling attempts in San Diego in just the past week, and comes nearly three weeks after three undocumented immigrants drowned when their boat crashed near Cabrillo National Monument.

In predawn darkness, lifeguards used boats and at least one rescue board to pluck people from the water near Marine Street Thursday. The panga then continued north and eventually came into shore about a mile away, where it capsized in the surf line near the Children’s Pool. A submerged victim was found nearby and did not survive.

In all, 15 people were taken into custody from the small panga-style vessel, said Border Patrol Supervisory Agent Jeffrey Stephenson.

Agents first spotted the boat off the coast near Point Loma around 5:10 a.m. and tracked it to La Jolla, hoping to see where it was going to make landfall.

Around 5:20 a.m., an agent saw several people in the water who appeared to be in distress and called San Diego lifeguards, said Border Patrol Agent Jacob MacIsaac.

Video shot by OnScene TV showed a Coast Guard helicopter circling over the water as lifeguards on a rescue boat and a rescue board worked to pluck people out of the ocean.

“When our lifeguards got at scene, there was people in the water — we did not have visuals of anyone on the actual vessel,” Lifeguard Capt. Maureen Hodges told reporters at a news conference. “Most of the victims did have life jackets either on or were holding onto them.”

Those who were rescued were transported by boat to lifeguard headquarters, where they were met by ambulances. After being evaluated, eight patients were transported to hospitals to be treated.

“The conditions out there today were rough,” Hodges said. “We have 4- to 6-foot surf and some heavy currents.”

The panga continued heading up the coast after the group of passengers jumped off. A short time later, it came into shore at Wipeout Beach near Coast Boulevard, about a mile away.

That’s where a person was found submerged in the water, said Lifeguard Lt. Ric Stell.

As the boat neared shore, it capsized in the surf line, Stell said.

“Usually when boats go into the surf they flip,” he said. The boat righted itself and ended up in an upright position in the sand.

The person in the water was brought to shore and CPR was performed but he or she did not survive, San Diego Fire-Rescue spokeswoman Mónica Muñoz said.

Some people were able to make it to shore on their own after jumping off the boat. OnScene TV showed at least two men on the beach being assisted by Border Patrol agents.

Information about the deceased victim and the other passengers, including ages and nationalities, were not immediately available.

People seeking to cross the border are increasingly turning to the sea as enforcement is heightened at land borders.

The La Jolla coastline has become a common area for smugglers to land boats. However, three previous attempts in the past week have targeted the shores near Sunset Cliffs, according to criminal complaints filed in San Diego federal court and interviews with authorities.

The first occurred in the early morning hours last Friday.

A Border Patrol agent watching the waters with an infrared camera spotted a panga-style boat about 2:15 a.m. approaching the coastline below Sunset Cliffs, according to court records.

The boat landed about 30 minutes later, in an area known as Garbage Beach, and the agent watched as a group of people made their way up a staircase and into the side yard of a nearby home.

Agents surrounded the home and ultimately found 14 people hiding the back yard. All were determined to be Mexican nationals.

Another boat laden with undocumented immigrants landed in the same area a day later.

The panga was spotted about 5:15 a.m. Saturday, again by an agent monitoring the coastline.

A group scrambled up the cliffs, and one person broke away and walked toward a vehicle parked nearby. The man approached the driver and asked in Spanish if he was there to pick them up.

Turned out, the driver was a Border Patrol agent — wearing a ballistic vest with his badge and the agency’s insignia — who had responded to the radio call. The agent identified himself as such and arrested the man.

While handcuffed, the man tried to run away but was quickly caught, according to the complaint.

Sixteen others, all Mexican citizens, were found in the surrounding area and detained on suspicion of being in the country illegally.

Early Monday, Coast Guard were sent out to intercept another panga coming in near the same spot about 2:50 a.m.

The boat’s driver ignored commands to stop. As the boat neared the surf line at Osprey Reef, its engine died and it began to drift toward rocks. San Diego lifeguards, aided by Coast Guard, responded in a small boat and hooked the panga with a rope to pull it away from the cliffs.

Twenty Mexicans and three Guatemalans were detained unharmed.

“The real danger here definitely is to the migrants that are on these vessels,” Agent MacIsaac said. “These are basically open hulled fishing vessels, they are loading them, overloading them with occupants, with gas cans.”

The crash on May 2 on the rocks near Cabrillo differed in that the boat was not a traditional panga but a larger trawler-like vessel. It was overloaded with 33 people when it ran aground and broke apart, throwing people into the sea. Three migrants, all Mexican, drowned. The suspected operator of the boat, a U.S. citizen, is facing federal criminal charges.

Border Patrol agents urge people not to put their lives into the hands of smugglers.

The boats used by smugglers often are “grossly overladen,” lack safety devices and sometimes are found off the coast “dead in the water,” MacIsaac said."

TXDOT's ""Click It or Ticket"" campaign urges Texans to remember to wear their seat belts.

MIDLAND COUNTY, Texas — Midland county's radio tower project is booting up again. COVID-19 has put it on the backburner.

""A project with this size takes a lot of time and a lot of resources to get put together. We had to acquire land and other things and so it's been a multi-year project,"" said Justin Stephenson, project infrastructure administrator for Midland county IT.

Over four years to be exact.

Adding three new radio towers and equipment to their existing tower is going to take officers' 50% portable coverage, to 95%.

This means officers will be able to communicate better and we'll be safer residents because of it.

""One has a little bit higher wattage antenna and so right now there is some better coverage in their car than on foot and so we're just trying to fill in the gaps with both,"" Stephenson said.

The piece commissioners are discussing this week is the generators.

""The generator ensures that the towers are still up and online and that the officers can still communicate even in things such as the power outage we had a few months ago,"" Stephenson said.

They want to get things moving again and put in the order now.

""Because COVID and other things. It seems just like there's a shortage of cars, we're trying to make sure we order the generators in a timely manor to have them here by the end of the year,"" Stephenson said.

Mediterranean,2021-05-29,,1.0,1,10.0,,,,Unknown,Sub-Saharan Africa,Drowning,Morocco,Western Mediterranean,"Off Achakar, Tangier, Morocco - embarked from the same location",https://archive.vn/wip/7bUKl,4,"June 02, 2021

Shortly before 7:00h CEST on 29 May 2021, we were alerted to an unseaworthy zodiac without a motor, that had left from Achakar, Morocco with 11 people, among them two women, just a few hours earlier.

A family member contacted us as he had lost contact with the boat hours ago and the weather was getting worse; there were 1.3m waves and 16kn winds. He sent us a position dated almost 2 hours ago, so we immediately tried to communicate with the people on board in order to get a new position and since we were completely unable to establish communication with them we decided to inform the competent authorities with the poor information we had.

Just after eight in the morning we sent an email and called MRCC Rabat in order to informing them about the situation. Their response was to call them back later. At 9:30h CEST we contacted back MRCC Rabat, and we were told that they had intercepted the boat but it had 10 people on board. We insisted there were 11 travellers onboard, to what they replied that numbers of people sometimes are incorrect and that the relatives must have made a mistake when giving us the exact number.

We reported to the family member what MRCC Rabat told us. He was sure there were 11 people since he was told there were going to be 12 but at the very last moment one person remained on land. We asked him to try to make contact with the people on board to confirm the rescue.

It was not until 15:50h CEST that we learned from the family member what had really happened. During the interception operation the boat capsized and people fell into the water, 10 people were rescued and one was left in the middle of the ocean. Despite the persistent demands of fellow passengers begging the Moroccan Navy not to quit the area the patrol vessel continued its journey to Tangier.

As we wrote on Saturday on our social network channels, we consider the Moroccan authorities responsible for this new death at the border and we also reiterate that they have neither the technical nor human resources to carry out SAR operations or to coordinate them."
North America,2021-06-01,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Mexico,Central America,"Harsh environmental conditions / lack of adequate shelter, food, water",United States of America,US-Mexico border crossing,"Unspecified location in the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range, southeast of Foothills, Yuma County, Arizona, USA",https://archive.ph/V1vob,5,"YUMA, Ariz. – Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents found two deceased individuals in separate locations in the desert southeast of the Foothills Tuesday.

An agent assigned to the Wellton station was tracking a group of migrants through the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range on Monday morning when he encountered a deceased male. The migrant, later identified as a 40-year-old Mexican national, was only a couple miles away from a rescue beacon. It is believed that the migrant had been deceased for approximately two weeks.

On Tuesday afternoon, Yuma Sector radio fielded a 911 call from C5, which is Mexico’s 911 equivalent, about a group in need of help south of the Yuma foothills. The caller stated that a female member of the group collapsed and was deceased.

Yuma Air Interdiction agents responded to the area and located the group, including the deceased female. Agents took the migrants into custody and the deceased female, a 20-year-old Guatemalan national, was turned over to the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office coroner. One of the members of the group was a 16-year-old guide from San Luis, Mexico.

“It doesn’t take much,” said Lenin Padilla, a Border Patrol agent and program manager assigned to the Yuma Sector Foreign Operations Branch. “Proof of that is the woman. She was only a couple miles north of the border. It’s hot out there.”

Yuma Sector Chief Patrol Agent Chris T. Clem said this is a tragic example of how smugglers exploit migrants.

“The smugglers have no regard for human life,” Chief Clem said. “Border Patrol agents will continue to do their best to mitigate entries and rescue migrants who need their help.”

Padilla, who is also the coordinator for Yuma Sector’s Missing Migrant Program, said Border Patrol is working with the Mexican government and other non-government organizations to try to prevent incidents like this from occurring. By putting out public service announcements in Mexico, they hope that migrants will avoid crossing the border in barren areas of the desert, especially during the summer.

“The most important thing is prevention,” Padilla said. “We are trying to prevent people from crossing the desert, especially in the summer months.”

Padilla also works closely with consulates, medical examiners, and coroners to help locate missing migrants and identify deceased migrants for the purpose of notifying family members.

For those who choose to ignore the warnings, rescue beacons and 911 placards are situated throughout the desert so migrants can summon help if they need to. During the month of May, Yuma Sector agents responded to 47 911 calls and rescued 126 migrants. Five dead bodies were recovered, three of whom were identified and two whose identities are unknown.

In addition, Padilla said there are two migrants who are unaccounted for. Their families reported them missing to their respective consulates after they planned to cross the desert into the U.S. and haven’t been heard from since.

“These were people who were in the desert and were never found,” Padilla said.

Padilla said so far in the first three days of June, the two bodies previously mentioned have been recovered and agents have responded to three 911 calls. Padilla expects those numbers to continue to rise.

“Unfortunately, we are expecting the number of 911 calls to increase as the summer months come,” he said."

On Monday (14) a Rohingya child and a woman were found dead on the riverbank at Hneela union of the upazila, said Teknaf Model police station officer-in-charge Md Hafizur Rahman.

The law enforcers suspect that the victims drowned after the boat, headed illegally for Bangladesh territory and with them on board, capsized in the river between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday, the Dhaka Tribune reported.

On Saturday afternoon, a woman and two children, said to be of the same family, were found dead in the river at the upazila’s Whykong union.

Police at the time said the trio presumably died while trying to swim across the river.

The following day, another child, believed to be a member of the same family, was found dead in Hneela union.

Meanwhile, multiple sources said that this particular area along the Bangladesh border was an active route for yaba smuggling and the deaths of the six people might be related to it.

“After being informed, a team from Teknaf police station went to the spot and recovered the bodies,” Teknaf Model police station Officer-in-Charge Hafizur Rahman said while talking to Dhaka Tribune.

“We believe that the three died while trying to cross the river in an attempt to trespass into Bangladesh territory. The woman is presumed to be 30-years-old, while the two children might be from 5-years to 7-years old,” he added."

One rescue was with the assistance of newly acquired Mobile Rescue Beacons (MRB). The individuals had crossed the border illegally between Rio Bravo and El Cenizo at separate times when they fell in distress. Sadly, one individual passed away due to heat related injuries.

Agents received a notification from Laredo Police Department Dispatch regarding a subject in distress. Agents in the area quickly found the first subject who appeared to be suffering from heat related injuries. Border Patrol agents certified as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) tended to her as Emergency Medical Services were requested. The individual was transported to a local hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

In the same area, the MRB was triggered, alerting agents that someone was in distress. This alert provided agents an exact location which led them directly to the lost individual. EMTs evaluated the individual and found him to be in good health.

While agents were tending to the second individual, a call from Laredo Sector Law Enforcement Information Systems Specialists (Dispatch) alerted agents of two more individuals who had fallen in heat related distress. Minutes later, Zapata County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch informed agents of an additional individual in distress in the area. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air Asset arrived and assisted agents in locating the lost individuals. Due to quick response time, these individuals were found to be in good health.

“Yesterday we highlighted Laredo Sector’s new Mobile Rescue Beacons (MRB) in national news. Today, this new technology saved a life. The U.S. Border Patrol will always prioritize human life. It is vital to remember that the only safe place to cross the border is through a designated Port of Entry,” said Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Carl E. Landrum.

Communication between our law enforcement partners in addition to the Mobile Rescue Beacon, played a vital role in saving the lives of the distressed individuals. Mobile Rescue Beacons are designed to aid individuals in distress and are strategically placed in rural areas in an effort to reduce the loss of lives.

Laredo Sector is extremely proud of the lifesaving work being done by agents in the field. These life-saving events continue to highlight the dangerous risks that migrants may face while attempting to illegally enter the U.S. and the dedication of the agents to provide aid to those in need. This incident should serve as a reminder to not undertake this dangerous journey .

When law enforcement arrived, they found the 35-year-old man and the body of his 15-year-old son. The man told authorities the two were “left behind” and ran out of water, according to the office. The father also told authorities they spent three days walking along the dirt road in hopes of being rescued.

Several agencies worked together to identify

a migrant death in Yuma Sector

Agents assigned to the Yuma station encountered the deceased woman under a tree near County 19th Street and Avenue 10E as they tracked a group of three migrants who illegally entered the United States. The Yuma County coroner responded to the scene and took custody of the woman and began the process of identifying her.

The woman had a Mexican identification card in her possession; however, after reaching out to the Mexican consulate, it was determined that the identification card was fraudulent, and it was not the deceased woman.

In their continued efforts to identify the woman, the Mexican consulate called a phone number that was found among her belongings. The number belonged to a family member of a 23-year-old Guatemalan woman. The family provided the woman’s name, and the Mexican and Guatemalan consulates relayed the information to the coroner, who then reached out to Yuma Sector’s Foreign Operations Branch (FOB) to search their database.

Border Patrol Agent Padilla, a program manager assigned to FOB, said a search of Yuma Sector’s processing database revealed that the woman had been apprehended by Wellton agents on June 9 and again by Yuma agents on June 11. As a result, the database contained a photo of the woman and her fingerprints.

The Yuma Sector Evidence Team (SET) then sent the fingerprints from their database along with the fingerprints from the coroner to a fingerprint expert in San Diego and the result was a match.

“Through collaboration and open lines of communication between the Mexican consulate, Guatemalan consulate, the Yuma County Coroner’s Office, the Yuma SET and the Yuma Sector FOB we were able to make a preliminary positive identification,” said Padilla.

He said the positive identification will be forwarded to the Guatemalan consulate, which will then notify the family.

“One of the rewarding aspects of my job is having the opportunity to share the Border Patrol humanitarian efforts and bring closure to the families who have lost a family member,” Padilla said.

Since the start of the fiscal year in October 2020, six deceased migrants have been recovered in Yuma Sector’s area of operations. Through the Missing Migrant Program and in collaboration with the Mexican consulate, migrants are urged against crossing the desert in the summer months as temperatures can exceed well over 100 degrees."

Sette migranti sono morti nel naufragio di un barcone avvenuto a circa 5 miglia da Lampedusa. L'imbarcazione sulla quale viaggiavano si sarebbe all'improvviso ribaltata e molti sono finiti in mare. I soccorritori hanno recuperato 46 superstiti, sette hanno perso la vita.Mentre le ricerche in mare aperto sono in corso ad opera delle motovedette di carabinieri, Capitaneria e guardia di finanza, all'hotspot sono stati ascoltati i superstiti anche per comprendere chi effettivamente manca all'appello. Ci sarebbero ancora altri 9 dispersi che potrebbero essere per la maggior parte bambini. Persone finite in mare perché alla vista delle due motovedette della Guardia costiera, ancor prima che iniziasse il soccorso, i migranti si sono spostati quasi tutti su una fiancata.Sono tutte donne, una delle quali incinta, le 7 vittime recuperate nel mare di Lampedusa. Lo conferma la procura di Agrigento, diretta da Luigi Patronaggio, che coordina un'inchiesta aperta contro ignoti per naufragi. I 46 superstiti sono stati trasferiti: 19 su una motovedetta e 27 su un'altra sempre della Guardia costiera.Oltre al naufragio è stata una notte di sbarchi quella che si è registrata a Lampedusa. Sono 256 i migranti approdati sull'isola, a partire dalle 3,30, con quattro diversi barconi.Tre imbarcazioni sono state soccorse al largo, la quarta - con 6 tunisini a bordo - è invece riuscita ad arrivare, alle 7 circa, direttamente in porto. Anche ieri c'erano stati 4 sbarchi sull'isola con un totale di 136 persone."

The identities of those killed in the accident were not immediately clear.

According to the authorities, the crash occurred in Van’s Muradiye district, where the vehicle caught fire after tumbling into a ditch.

Among the dead were 11 migrants and a person who helped organize their illegal transport, the authorities were quoted as saying.

The injured were taken to hospital and the owner of the bus was detained, they added.

Situated near Turkey's eastern border with Iran, the city of Van is used as a crossing point for migrants on their long journey to reach Europe, with many coming from Afghanistan.

In July 2020, a boat carrying up to 60 migrants sank in Lake Van.

Medical teams, firefighters, security forces as well as emergency personnel from Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) were dispatched to the scene.

Migrants – mostly from Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan – regularly cross the Iranian border into Turkey on foot before being ferried west to cities such as Istanbul and Ankara.

Journeys often turn lethal, be it a short journey to Greece by sea aboard unsafe boats or in overcrowded minibuses and trucks.

Turkish security forces rescued or held some 352 irregular migrants over a 24-hour period on Monday and Tuesday last week across a number of provinces in Turkey.

According to a statement, security units were tipped off that a large group of foreign nationals were at a social establishment located on the highway.

All 101 migrants, who had entered Turkey at different times, were held and two suspected human traffickers were arrested.

In the Belen district of southern Hatay province, at least 28 migrants who were all Syrian nationals and had illegally entered the country were held.

Acting on a tip, security teams stopped three vehicles and identified the migrants, according to local security sources.

While the migrants were sent to the local migration office, legal action was initiated against the three Syrian drivers.

Separately, a Turkish coast guard team was dispatched off the coast of Ayvacık in northwestern Çanakkale province to rescue 25 asylum-seekers.

The asylum-seekers were trying to reach Europe by sailboat, according to a statement by the Coast Guard Command.

Another 43 asylum-seekers, who were pushed back by the Greek coast guard into Turkish territorial waters in the Aegean Sea, were also rescued in Çanakkale.

Four suspects were arrested for alleged human trafficking while the asylum-seekers were sent to the local migration office.

Another group of 25 asylum-seekers was rescued by the Turkish coast guard, who were conducting a routine patrol off the coast of Bodrum in Muğla province.

Pushbacks are considered contrary to international refugee protection agreements that outline people should not be expelled or returned to a country where their life or safety might be in danger due to their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a social or political group.

Turkey already hosts nearly 4 million Syrian migrants, more than any country in the world. Officials say the country cannot handle another refugee wave.

In March 2016, the EU and Turkey reached an agreement to stop irregular migration through the Aegean Sea and improve the conditions of more than 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.

The deal has been successful in stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, but the EU’s reluctance to take in refugees from Turkey, and bureaucratic hurdles in transferring promised funds for refugees, have led to sharp criticism from Turkish politicians.

Ankara criticized the EU for failing to fulfill its pledge to provide funding for migrants and refugees in Turkey as part of the pact while allocating billions of euros to Greece.

Five years on, the pact is failing as Turkey struggles with increased numbers of migrants, while the EU is more divided than ever over its asylum policy.

""The proposed new financial aid package is for Syrian refugees, not Turkey, and is essentially a step to be taken to ensure the EU's own peace and security. Reducing migration cooperation to just a financial dimension is a big mistake. Aiming for close cooperation in this area would be beneficial for everyone,"" it said."

A migrant was found dead late last month on a rugged hillside a few miles north of the border, local and federal authorities confirmed this week.

A volunteer search-and-rescue organization alerted authorities to the 33-year-old man’s death around 2:45 p.m. June 30, according to statements from the U.S. Border Patrol and Medical Examiner’s Office.

Personnel from the Sheriff’s Department were sent in search of the body; an ASTREA helicopter crew helped locate it, sheriff’s spokesperson Lt. Amber Baggs said in a statement.

According to the Medical Examiner’s Office, the body was on a mountain just north of Otay Mountain Truck Trail, a few miles north of the border and southwest of Dulzura.

“The decedent is believed to be a missing person from Mexico seen crossing the U.S./Mexico border with a group of other border crossers,” the Medical Examiner’s Office said in a statement.

The man’s name was not released because his family had not yet been notified of his death, a county spokesperson said Friday.

Baggs said deputies wrote an incident report documenting that they had found the body, then turned the investigation over to the Medical Examiner’s Office. That agency is now handling the investigation and said in a statement that the man’s cause and manner of death are both pending."

The ranch manager eyed the terrain and followed the stench. He found the woman’s body, like so many others in the south Texas brush : splayed in the weeds, arms dark with decay, raised above her head as if in surrender.

The rancher knew what to do. He had come upon 15 such migrants over the years . He called Brooks County sheriff’s dispatchers. They issued a Code 500, a dead body call, summoning a deputy, two Border Patrol agents, a justice of the peace and a funeral director.

They met the rancher shortly before noon at the gate of Los Palos Ranch, about 75 miles north of the border . Together they waded through knee-high, thorny weeds, mindful that the June heat rouses rattlesnakes from their burrows. The men gazed down to where she lay — face gone, skull picked clean by scavengers, hair and lower jaw dragged a few feet from a body not yet skeletal.

They guessed the woman had died of exhaustion or dehydration.

“They wait over there and move at night,” said the rancher, pointing to a nearby stand of mesquite, where he and his wife sometimes spy the passing shadows of those heading north

The deputy wrapped the body in a white sheet. He then lifted it into a gray bag and helped the funeral director load it into the back of his Ford Explorer for transport to the sheriff’s morgue. It would be fingerprinted and tested for the coronavirus. The men found no trace of a name. It would be days before fingerprints told investigators that the woman was Rosario Yanira Girón de Orellana, a 41-year-old single mother who had traveled more than 1,500 miles from El Salvador.

VIDEO | 02:23 Losing Rosario: A mother dies crossing the border before reuniting with her daughter Authorities transport the body of Rosario Yanira Giron de Orellana, a 41-year-old migrant from El Salvador who died before she could be reunited with her 15-year-old daughter. Her body was found on a ranch in Falfurrias, Texas.

Brooks County and the Rio Grande Valley to the south have been popular smuggling routes for decades, a reliable barometer of migrant deaths borderwide. Six months into 2021, deaths in the county had already reached 55, up from a total of 34 last year and above the five-year average. Migrants here often dial 911 from their cellphones, stranded without water and begging for help. Some days this summer, officials recovered three bodies. All were adults, more than half male. Their identification was from Central America or Mexico. Relatives searching for missing migrants this summer have flown in from as far as California and New York.

Unlike the Arizona desert, another migrant deathtrap , south Texas ranchland at first glance appears verdant. But it’s a deadly mirage. Temperatures climb to nearly 100 degrees. Of the county’s 944 square miles, about twice the size of the city of Los Angeles, only a fraction of a square mile has water. Los Palos and other ranches have cattle troughs and tanks, but they’re teeming with bacteria, and migrants who drink from them have died. Those who don’t succumb to the elements are sometimes abandoned by smugglers.

Agents and deputies do what they can to patrol suspected smuggler drop-off and pickup spots, including County Road 107, the road closest to where Rosario’s body was found, a milelong stretch of caliche that dead-ends at Los Palos Ranch. Migrant advocates have placed more than 150 blue barrels of water on CR 107 and other local highways. But Rosario was discovered miles from the road, beyond sight of the barrels.

She had been found without a purse, phone, passport or other identification. Her black hair was cinched in a blue scrunchie. Her black striped shirt was pulled up to reveal a pink lace bra above black pants. Smugglers often instruct migrants to dress in black — good camouflage at night but brutally hot after sunrise.

The deputy checked her pockets: nothing. She wore no jewelry, just a plastic rosary and a string of rainbow beads with a medallion that said, in Spanish, “Virgin, please guide my path.”

“What is the time?” asked one of the Border Patrol agents.

It was 12:16 p.m. The justice of the peace pronounced Rosario dead. Once the funeral director drove the body to the morgue, agents photographed her blackened fingers, hoping to identify prints. They sent a picture of her left thumbprint to the Salvadoran Consulate. A match came back the next day.

The daughter of a farmworker, Rosario grew up in the coastal town of San Julián, population 22,000, about 40 miles west of the capital. She was slender, shorter than 5 feet tall, the second of nine siblings, some of whom described her as a second mother, a homebody they nicknamed “Chaito.”

Devout but headstrong, Rosario celebrated her quinceañera not with a party but by reciting the rosary with friends and family at home. She loved her namesake roses but rarely received them. Married at 21, she had a daughter, Adriana Orellana de Girón, then in recent years she separated from her husband and moved back home. Rosario seldom went out; she mainly went to church, where she taught catechism classes.

Rosario raised not only her daughter but her siblings, nieces and nephews. She took them to school, church and a local park, helped with their homework and put them to bed. She watched most of them depart for the U.S. and settle where her father had before he was deported 11 years earlier: Houston.

Rosario never spoke of migrating. But in November, she celebrated her daughter’s quinceañera, buying her a sleeveless aqua dress and speaking eloquently about her passage into womanhood. Privately, her sisters said, Rosario worried that Adriana had grown old enough to be targeted by gangs that ruled the neighborhood.

“When she would call me, I would tell her the life is very different here,” recalled Rosario’s older sister Maria Huezo, 42, whose daughter, also named Adriana, will celebrate her quinceañera in the fall. “Here there is work, but you have no time for your kids. There you are with your kids, but there is no work.”

Huezo had crossed the border illegally about 20 years earlier. She didn’t feel she had the right to tell anyone else not to come. But none of the family had traveled north on foot; they had all been caught soon after crossing the Rio Grande. And none had arrived since President Trump was elected and cracked down on asylum seekers.

“I never imagined Rosario would come,” Huezo said. “To decide to take this path, you have to be brave. And she never went out of the house. She didn’t know how to defend herself in the street, in the world.”

On March 16, about 6 a.m., Rosario said goodbye to her mother and caught a ride with her daughter north. It would take them 15 days, moving from town to town, before they reached the Mexican border city of Reynosa.

Rosario knew from talking to other migrants that if she crossed the border with Adriana, the Border Patrol would send them back to Mexico due to pandemic restrictions. But if Adriana went without an adult, she would be released to relatives in Houston.

Rosario’s younger sister Vilma Girón, 38, had made the same journey in 2014. She was detained by the Border Patrol, released after a few months and sent for her two daughters. They all claimed asylum. The 17-year-old was entering seventh grade; the 21-year-old had graduated high school and was working at an Amazon warehouse, where she would soon qualify for tuition assistance to study at the University of Houston.

“That is why she came,” Girón said of Rosario over a recent breakfast of pupusas. “That is why we all did it: for our children. We never thought this would happen to us. Where we live, there are so many families who have come, all of them.”

Rosario didn’t tell her daughter that she was sending her across the border alone until they parted on April 2. She arranged for a fellow migrant mother traveling with the group to pick Adriana up. When the woman arrived, Rosario took the girl aside.

“We have to separate,” Adriana recalled her mother saying. “It’s better for you. We will reunite. God bless and keep you.”

There would be about 10 migrants in their group, all eligible to enter the U.S. because they were either mothers with young children or youths like Adriana without their parents. Thin, shy and small for her age, Adriana didn’t know how to swim. But she followed the other migrants onto an inflated raft and across the Rio Grande. They were soon detained by the Border Patrol.

Adriana was held for several weeks, then was released to her family in Houston with permission to stay until her asylum case was decided. (Due to a court backlog, her first hearing isn’t until Jan. 12.)

Meanwhile, Rosario had crossed the border to a smuggler’s stash house in the Rio Grande Valley, where she stayed for a couple of weeks before heading with a group to Houston. She had a Salvadoran cellphone and sent WhatsApp messages to her daughter via her brother in San Julián.

“Don’t worry daughter, we are good,” she wrote at 8 p.m. May 26. “We walked two days and two nights and we are in a place where we can rest.”

Then the messages suddenly stopped.

That scared Rosario’s six siblings in the U.S. None had been incommunicado during their journeys north, unless they were detained by the Border Patrol. Her younger brother, whose asylum case was pending, contacted his immigration attorney, who searched unsuccessfully for Rosario at immigration detention and hospitals.

Days later, Rosario’s sister Vilma Girón started receiving WhatsApp messages from a stranger with a Salvadoran number who claimed to have migrated with Rosario. “Oscar C” said that when Rosario stopped walking on a ranch May 29, fellow migrants left her behind with water and a cellphone.

“He said she was tired, but her health seemed OK,” Girón said. “She was waiting there for immigration to find her.”

Another man contacted her brother in El Salvador to say Rosario’s group had left a second feverish woman behind who was later rescued by the Border Patrol.

Rosario’s relatives were initially afraid to contact U.S. authorities, because many of them had entered the country illegally. Instead, they phoned the Brooks County-based South Texas Human Rights Center, which distributes the water barrels and fields calls from families searching for missing migrants. Volunteers agreed to help them search and relayed information to the Border Patrol.

One of Rosario’s brothers and a nephew, Huezo’s son — both of whom were in the country legally — traveled from Houston to Brooks County to search for her June 3.

Huezo texted Oscar for more information, and he responded that Rosario was “at the edge of a sandy street in front of a ranch.”

“What did she have with her?” Huezo asked.

Her documents and her phone, Oscar said, noting that the phone was turned off, “so that it had a battery.”

“I have a lot of faith in God that everything will be good with her,” he wrote.

The next day Oscar sent Huezo a Google Maps location for Rosario. She forwarded the coordinates to her son in Brooks County. He and his uncle got within two miles of where Rosario’s body was later found but were stopped by a locked ranch gate. Nearby, they saw discarded shoes and water jugs.

“I could tell there were people there recently, because the night before it had rained, and the tracks were still there,” Huezo’s son said.

The next day, Huezo messaged Oscar again.

“What else did my sister have, other than a black shirt and pants?” she asked. “What kind of shoes did she wear?”

“Gray shoes with pink on the outside,” he replied.

Huezo had seen a photo of Rosario, taken just before she left for the U.S., in which she wore gray-and-pink Nikes.

“When I saw that,” Huezo said of Oscar’s message, “I knew it was my sister.”

She tried to send Oscar more questions. He never answered. (Oscar did not respond to messages from The Times, either, except to say: “Thank you for writing the article. I am really the last person to contribute.”)

The next day, investigators notified Huezo that they had identified Rosario’s body. She went to her sister’s house to tell Adriana.

“All she had to do was see me,” Huezo recalled.

It’s not clear how Rosario died. Her family wonders why she was found without her documents or phone and why she never called 911 for help. Authorities didn’t conduct an autopsy. The mystery of how she ended up alone in the brush may never be solved. Her relatives would never view her body, dress her or place a rosary in her casket.

Rosario’s family let her daughter decide where she would be buried: El Salvador or the U.S. Adriana wanted her mother nearby, where she could visit the grave. Huezo and two brothers — between shifts at McDonald’s — built an altar to Rosario, encircled by votive candles and the roses she had loved, in their double-wide trailer. They recited the rosary for nine nights, the traditional novena. And they helped their parents apply for humanitarian visas from the U.S. government to attend her funeral June 29.

The visa requests were denied. Instead, Rosario’s parents watched the funeral Mass on Facebook Live. A priest they didn’t know spoke about the daughter he had never met at a church they had never seen. Relatives wore white T-shirts embossed with black rosaries and a quote: “Today we take different paths, but I will always take with me what I learned from you.”

By the time they reached the cemetery, a thunderstorm had rolled in. Few in the crowd of about 100 had umbrellas. But none left, not even the uniformed McDonald’s workers who had never met Rosario. Cemetery workers had to wheel over a second tent.

Adriana stood beside her mother’s grave in sneakers and a pleated black skirt. She sobbed as the casket was lowered, embracing a young uncle, one of many relatives her mother had raised. The rain stopped. The family released a white string of balloons shaped like a rosary. A guitarist played Spanish Christian pop songs, and some sang along, their voices soon drowned out by the hum of an earthmover.

They had already affixed a temporary metal plaque to the grave labeled “Rosario.” Last week, Adriana selected her mother’s headstone: gray granite, with two vases attached for her roses. It will be installed by next month, around the same time Adriana starts ninth grade."
North America,2021-07-17,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,Mexico,Central America,Accidental death,United States of America,US-Mexico border crossing,"In the Valley Baptist Medical Center, Harlingen, Cameron County, Texas, USA - after falling from the border wall on June 16",https://archive.vn/vwQ2Z,5,"An illegal immigrant who fell from the border wall in Texas last month has succumbed to his injuries, the Border Patrol said Saturday.

The Mexican man was found by agents on the U.S. side after the June 16 fall, which left him with severe injuries to his leg. He was taken to a hospital in Harlingen, Texas, where he also tested positive for the coronavirus.

He underwent two surgeries for his injuries, but never regained consciousness after going under anesthesia. He was removed from life support on Friday and was pronounced dead by hospital staff.

He was still on hospital watch by Border Patrol agents at the time, and so he is designated a death in custody.

The man, whose name wasn’t released by authorities, is the latest in a growing list of deaths amid the border surge that began with the new Biden administration.

Drownings, car crashes and exposure to the elements are all taking a larger toll than usual with the higher numbers of border jumpers.

The wall is also part of the deadly equation, with migrants slipping or, in some cases, being tossed from the heights of the barrier.

The boat carrying around 45 migrants sank off the coast of Crete. Despite the majority of people being rescued, including 17 Kurds, eight Kurds are still missing: seven from the Kurdistan Region and another from Iran’s Kurdish areas, known as Rojhelat.



Peshawa Rashid was born in 1993 in Sulaimani’s Xalakan town. After getting married in 2016 and having a daughter, he and his wife eventually decided to leave the country and headed to Turkey on June 19 in hopes of finding a better life in Europe.



Rashid’s cousin Ranj Omar told Rudaw on Tuesday that Rashid’s parents are now sure that their son has died and are arranging a funeral – held at home due to COVID-19 - to say their final goodbyes.



“One of my cousins has been in Greece for 17 years. After the incident he went and saw the wife and daughter and they told him that Peshawa drowned in front of their eyes,” he said.



“They are in good health, but his wife is mentally wrecked and is always crying.”





Last month, the body of a one-year-old Kurdish boy who drowned in the English Channel last October was found more than 900 kilometers away in Norway. Trying to reach the UK, he and his family made the perilous journey from Iran's Sardasht area to the port of Calais in France. He was buried with his family on Friday according to Norwegian media, months after his parents and siblings were laid to rest.



Rashid’s widow, Rahen Pirot, told Omar that the boat was overcrowded – with the smuggler allowing 10 extra people to board.



In his last voice message sent to his father, Rashid said that they would be boarding a boat to Greece and hoped to reconnect with him once in Europe.



“They are now taking our phones from us and we are leaving. We might not leave until midnight, but if we no longer have net connection then we have left,” he said in the voice message shared with Rudaw.



Political, economic and social instability is pushing people to migrate at a “dangerous” rate, Ari Jalal, head of the Summit Foundation for Refugee and Displaced Affairs (Lutka) told Rudaw radio in June. Every year, thousands of Kurds and Iraqi citizens undertake dangerous journeys to Europe by land and by sea in hope of finding a better life abroad.Last month, the body of a one-year-old Kurdish boy whoin the English Channel last October was found more than 900 kilometers away in Norway.

According to data from the organization, 26,972 Iraqi citizens sought asylum in Europe in the first half of 2021, and five people died en route. This does not include those under 18.



In 2020 the numbers were considerably lower due to COVID-19 restrictions, but casualties were higher. Out of the 34,000 who migrated in 2020, a total of 35 people went missing or died on the way. Jalal noted it is unclear how many of them are Kurdish migrants as migrants’ ethnicities are not recorded.

A migrant crossing attempt turned deadly when a man was struck and killed by a train Monday night along the border in Downtown El Paso.

The death occurred as U.S. authorities have seen an increase in unauthorized migrants risking dangerous attempts to cross the El Paso-Juárez border on freight trains.

El Paso police said that a 42-year-old man died when he was struck by a 64-car Union Pacific train shortly before 8 p.m. Monday at the Union Pacific rail yard at 1115 S. Stanton St.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers searching for undocumented migrants on the train found three people and later found the man who died underneath the train, police and CBP said. Police has initially said the body was found by Border Patrol agents.

CBP officers do not believe the migrants were linked to the man who died, an agency spokesman said.

The rail yard is next to the Rio Grande along the César Chávez Border Highway by the Stanton Street international bridge.

The man's identity was withheld by police pending notification of his family.

The police Special Traffic Investigations Unit continue investigating the deadly accident.

Earlier this year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection in El Paso began finding an increasing number of migrants hiding on trains , on top of freight cars and clinging onto the undercarriage in attempts to enter the United States.

CBP officials have described the train-crossing attempts as extremely dangerous. Some of the migrants detained were children.

CBP officers have detained 406 migrants found on trains in El Paso in fiscal year 2021.

There are an estimated 6,500 rail cars that enter El Paso from Mexico every month, CBP said. The trains are inspected by CBP officers as they slowly roll across the border.

There are two international rail crossings on each side of the Paso del Norte Bridge in Downtown."

Published 9:00 a.m. ET Jul. 31, 2021

Falfurrias, Texas — A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent scrutinized video of a dying migrant on her cellphone, trying to match the background to the ranch she was searching for his body last month.

""Can I see the picture real quick, the background?"" another agent asked.

Agent Nancy Balogh held out her phone. In the two minutes of video, 25-year-old Yoel Nieto Valladares lay on the sandy ground, shirtless and sweating, jeans cinched with a rectangular metal belt buckle. Nieto was barely able to sip from a Coke as another man fanned him with a black cap. The dying man's hands twitched, a tattoo of his father and younger brother's initials visible on his arm. His eyes rolled.

""How do you feel, guy? Hey, how do you feel?"" the man filming asked, panning to show a dozen others dressed all in black, the color favored by smugglers working at night.

Nieto shushed him, smiling.

""This is bad, he's delirious,"" said the man filming.

The dying man groaned.

Moments later, in a second minutelong video, Nieto's black polo shirt was on and his arms lay atop it, limp. His eyes were open, staring.

A smuggler had sent the videos to Nieto's family with GPS coordinates. ""I really hope we find him,"" Balogh said.

———

Several years ago, the U.S. Border Patrol launched a Missing Migrant Program in Arizona — though the agency's primary mission remained apprehending migrants — that has since expanded borderwide. Their relationship with migrant advocates had grown strained. In recent years, the Border Patrol had even helped prosecute some who left water and other supplies for migrants in the desert.

But the agency's approach has now evolved amid an increase in migration and deaths.

Brooks County — about 75 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley — has become the Border Patrol's laboratory, a place to test approaches they're already extending across the border. A three-person missing-migrant team trained in forensics is working with an intelligence officer to help identify migrant remains.

The agency also added equipment and technology to help locate stranded migrants faster. It installed more than 1,400 rescue signs across the region labeled with GPS coordinates. Agents obtained GPS coordinates for more than 22,000 landmarks that can be referenced during a migrant's 911 call — from power poles to windmills, pipelines and cattle guards. And they positioned 30 mobile, solar-powered rescue beacons in remote areas with little to no cellphone reception. The beacons are equipped with cameras that have already led to the rescue of a migrant.

By summer's end, the beacons will alert agents' cellphones directly. By year's end, they plan to have 170 beacons nationwide, which can be used to rescue migrants and investigate, Supervisory Agent Brandon Copp said.

Despite the summer heat, which usually decreases migration, the number of migrants arriving at the border last month — 188,829 — was the largest in years. The busiest area for crossings was south Texas, where agents earlier this month stopped 736 migrants in three groups near the Rio Grande. As of last month, they had helped recover more than 324 migrant remains and conducted 9,201 rescues nationwide, 81% more than all of last year.

""If we get facial recognition of a guide, we can tie them to that migrant's death,"" Copp said.

Like many of Texas's 254 counties, Brooks — population 7,100 — doesn't have a medical examiner. Death investigations are handled by justices of the peace unless the county pays an outside expert. Local funeral homes historically cut corners burying migrant dead. Researchers investigating unmarked migrant graves at a local cemetery in recent years found multiple migrant bodies buried together, some in plastic bags and milk crates. They had to exhume and catalog DNA in international databases to help identify them.

Now the sheriff's office is working with the Border Patrol to more quickly identify and release migrant remains without sending them for autopsies or DNA testing, which can be expensive and time-consuming. The sheriff just got a secondhand refrigerated trailer on loan from the state funeral home association, used for COVID-19 dead during the pandemic. Deputies and Border Patrol agents now store unidentified bodies there as they investigate.

Because of changes in county ordinances, some of the Border Patrol agents in south Texas, El Paso and Tucson have trained to photograph dead migrants' fingerprints to help consulates identify them. They also learned to recover fingerprints from bodies that have decayed or been submerged in water.

""Never thought I'd be doing this, the forensic side of it, the compassion,"" said Agent Jerry Passement while searching for Nieto's body. ""It's a puzzle we've got to try to put together.""

The process of locating missing migrants often begins when those in distress call 911 from their cellphones, stranded and desperate for water. Dispatchers request their GPS coordinates, then connect them to the Border Patrol's operations center, where agents also try to locate them.

The search can be daunting. A Guatemalan man who called last month said he had wandered for two days, far from any road, sign or light. Agents couldn't locate him.

""I am lost and my companion died overnight. I'm alone here,"" another 28-year-old Honduran migrant told dispatchers on May 18. ""I'm bad. I can't walk.""

Later that day, agents rescued him and recovered his friend's body.

Copp and his team see migrants and their families as a resource. In at least one case this summer, a family helped agents bust a smuggler and rescue 42 migrants from a stash house.

""The humanitarian aspect, we're putting more of an effort into it,"" Balogh said as she searched for Nieto. ""Nobody deserves to die like this.""

They're working with Eddie Canales, founder of the Brooks County-based South Texas Human Rights Center, which has relayed information to authorities and helped save at least 50 migrants in recent months, Canales said.

""We're seeing a phenomenal increase in the calls that we're getting regarding people going missing,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Canales checked a dozen of the group's more than 150 water barrels, built on nearby ranches for migrants. In the last month, migrants had taken seven jugs of water, 28 gallons total. One half-empty barrel was surrounded by discarded clothes. Another contained five wilted dollar bills, probably left by a grateful migrant. Sometimes, supporters leave extra food and water. But last month, some barrels were stolen, along with $200 in supplies. The thieves were never caught.

Smugglers had offered Nieto's family a choice: Pay more — about $11,000 each — or risk a long, dangerous journey to ensure that he and cousin Heyder Perdomo Nieto, 31, reached South Carolina.

""We decided to pay more so that they could come safely,"" said Jhoselyn Nieto, 34.

She and a cousin in Honduras said the men had grown up in the capital, Tegucigalpa, and were ill-equipped to survive in the brush. Nieto, her cousin, known as ""Gato"" because of his green eyes, was a college-educated call center operator who dreamed of working at a bank. Perdomo, her brother, made furniture and cared for his 8-year-old daughter. Smugglers promised that the men would travel mostly by car, walking only about eight hours in Texas to circumvent a Border Patrol checkpoint.

""They lied,"" she said.

Her cousin would die during a four-day trek with 18 other Central American migrants through arid ranches with little food or water. Perdomo would stay with his cousin's body, abandoned by their guide, lost. He waited six hours, until his father got on the phone and told him to leave, ""because you are still living.""

Perdomo set off into the ranches about 7 that night.

His sister called the smuggler and accused him of lying to the family and killing her cousin.

""He said, no, he was alive, that they both were OK. 'They're coming to Houston, you have to wait,'"" she said. ""So, we waited for them.""

The family debated whether to contact authorities, afraid of how the smuggler might react if he still had the men. The next day, when she messaged her brother, the guide responded that they were headed to Houston.

But they never arrived.

When she messaged the following day, the guide stopped responding.

Four days later, after she wrote demanding the truth, someone claiming to be a fellow migrant said one of the men had died and the other was presumed dead.

""You lie,"" she wrote. ""How can we find them?""

""Sadly, this is a consequence for those who come here,"" the stranger wrote.

""There are consequences, but you played your part,"" she responded. ""Tell me the location and send me a video if he is dead.""

He sent her the GPS coordinates and videos.

She watched in horror, realizing the smuggler had lied, and her brother was missing.

""We didn't know if he was living or dead,"" she said.

That's when, on June 2, she sent the videos to the Border Patrol.

The next day, agents spent a half-hour combing the brush before they saw vultures circling.

""They found him,"" Balogh said, and crossed herself as she always does when they locate a migrant's body.

At first, agents couldn't be sure it was Nieto. Scavengers had dragged what was left of the body under a log, wearing jeans and a blackened shirt. Had Nieto been missing long enough to be so decomposed, agents wondered? A researcher accompanying them said vultures could pick a body clean within hours.

""We may have to do DNA,"" Copp said, which could take months.

Agents checked the body for identification, but found none. Then they saw a black polo shirt in the grass, a Coke bottle and a belt that matched the videos.

""That's for sure the belt buckle,"" Copp said.

They had found Nieto. Agents notified a justice of the peace, who pronounced him dead.

""The sad thing is, the family held onto that video for almost a week,"" Copp said.

There was no sign of Perdomo, or whether he could have been saved, had officials been alerted sooner.

———

That day, after the Border Patrol called to notify the family that it had found Nieto's body, they got their first call from Perdomo.

He was with a smuggler in Houston.

""He said he was OK, but we had to pay again,"" his sister said: $4,000 on top of the $11,000 they had already paid for each of the men.

After he left his cousin's body, Perdomo had nearly died, walking overnight and part of the next day. He stumbled upon another group of migrants whose guide took pity on him, gave him water, tuna and chocolate. Perdomo was so dehydrated, he vomited. He asked if they could retrieve his cousin's body.

""No, he's dead,"" the guide said, ""But we can help you.""

Fellow migrants had to support Perdomo's shoulders as they walked. Wounded, dirty and hungry, he finally arrived on June 15. He was still recovering last week.

""He cries for Yoel. He remembers him. He tells me things that happened on the road,"" his sister said.

It wasn't clear what caused Nieto's death. His father decided to have him cremated, so that he could have a funeral in South Carolina. But the Honduran Consulate insisted that the body be DNA-tested, which staff told the family could take up to eight months, Jhoselyn Nieto said.

""We want to recover his body as soon as possible so my uncle can have peace,"" she said. ""He can't have him alive; at least he can have his ashes."""

Published 9:00 a.m. ET Jul. 31, 2021

Falfurrias, Texas — A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent scrutinized video of a dying migrant on her cellphone, trying to match the background to the ranch she was searching for his body last month.

""Can I see the picture real quick, the background?"" another agent asked.

Agent Nancy Balogh held out her phone. In the two minutes of video, 25-year-old Yoel Nieto Valladares lay on the sandy ground, shirtless and sweating, jeans cinched with a rectangular metal belt buckle. Nieto was barely able to sip from a Coke as another man fanned him with a black cap. The dying man's hands twitched, a tattoo of his father and younger brother's initials visible on his arm. His eyes rolled.

""How do you feel, guy? Hey, how do you feel?"" the man filming asked, panning to show a dozen others dressed all in black, the color favored by smugglers working at night.

Nieto shushed him, smiling.

""This is bad, he's delirious,"" said the man filming.

The dying man groaned.

Moments later, in a second minutelong video, Nieto's black polo shirt was on and his arms lay atop it, limp. His eyes were open, staring.

A smuggler had sent the videos to Nieto's family with GPS coordinates. ""I really hope we find him,"" Balogh said.

Several years ago, the U.S. Border Patrol launched a Missing Migrant Program in Arizona — though the agency's primary mission remained apprehending migrants — that has since expanded borderwide. Their relationship with migrant advocates had grown strained. In recent years, the Border Patrol had even helped prosecute some who left water and other supplies for migrants in the desert.

But the agency's approach has now evolved amid an increase in migration and deaths.

Brooks County — about 75 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley — has become the Border Patrol's laboratory, a place to test approaches they're already extending across the border. A three-person missing-migrant team trained in forensics is working with an intelligence officer to help identify migrant remains.

The agency also added equipment and technology to help locate stranded migrants faster. It installed more than 1,400 rescue signs across the region labeled with GPS coordinates. Agents obtained GPS coordinates for more than 22,000 landmarks that can be referenced during a migrant's 911 call — from power poles to windmills, pipelines and cattle guards. And they positioned 30 mobile, solar-powered rescue beacons in remote areas with little to no cellphone reception. The beacons are equipped with cameras that have already led to the rescue of a migrant.

By summer's end, the beacons will alert agents' cellphones directly. By year's end, they plan to have 170 beacons nationwide, which can be used to rescue migrants and investigate, Supervisory Agent Brandon Copp said.

Despite the summer heat, which usually decreases migration, the number of migrants arriving at the border last month — 188,829 — was the largest in years. The busiest area for crossings was south Texas, where agents earlier this month stopped 736 migrants in three groups near the Rio Grande. As of last month, they had helped recover more than 324 migrant remains and conducted 9,201 rescues nationwide, 81% more than all of last year.

""If we get facial recognition of a guide, we can tie them to that migrant's death,"" Copp said.

Like many of Texas's 254 counties, Brooks — population 7,100 — doesn't have a medical examiner. Death investigations are handled by justices of the peace unless the county pays an outside expert. Local funeral homes historically cut corners burying migrant dead. Researchers investigating unmarked migrant graves at a local cemetery in recent years found multiple migrant bodies buried together, some in plastic bags and milk crates. They had to exhume and catalog DNA in international databases to help identify them.

Now the sheriff's office is working with the Border Patrol to more quickly identify and release migrant remains without sending them for autopsies or DNA testing, which can be expensive and time-consuming. The sheriff just got a secondhand refrigerated trailer on loan from the state funeral home association, used for COVID-19 dead during the pandemic. Deputies and Border Patrol agents now store unidentified bodies there as they investigate.

Because of changes in county ordinances, some of the Border Patrol agents in south Texas, El Paso and Tucson have trained to photograph dead migrants' fingerprints to help consulates identify them. They also learned to recover fingerprints from bodies that have decayed or been submerged in water.

""Never thought I'd be doing this, the forensic side of it, the compassion,"" said Agent Jerry Passement while searching for Nieto's body. ""It's a puzzle we've got to try to put together.""

The process of locating missing migrants often begins when those in distress call 911 from their cellphones, stranded and desperate for water. Dispatchers request their GPS coordinates, then connect them to the Border Patrol's operations center, where agents also try to locate them.

The search can be daunting. A Guatemalan man who called last month said he had wandered for two days, far from any road, sign or light. Agents couldn't locate him.

""I am lost and my companion died overnight. I'm alone here,"" another 28-year-old Honduran migrant told dispatchers on May 18. ""I'm bad. I can't walk.""

Later that day, agents rescued him and recovered his friend's body.

Copp and his team see migrants and their families as a resource. In at least one case this summer, a family helped agents bust a smuggler and rescue 42 migrants from a stash house.

""The humanitarian aspect, we're putting more of an effort into it,"" Balogh said as she searched for Nieto. ""Nobody deserves to die like this.""

They're working with Eddie Canales, founder of the Brooks County-based South Texas Human Rights Center, which has relayed information to authorities and helped save at least 50 migrants in recent months, Canales said.

""We're seeing a phenomenal increase in the calls that we're getting regarding people going missing,"" he said.

Mediterranean,2021-07-30,,3.0,3,10.0,2.0,,1.0,Democratic Republic of the Congo,Middle Africa,Drowning,Greece,Eastern Mediterranean,"Near Lesbos, Greece, along the maritime border with Türkiye.",https://archive.ph/wMGbX,5,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A search and rescue operation is underway Friday near Greece’s island of Lesbos along the maritime border with Turkey, after an inflatable dinghy carrying migrants apparently sank, authorities said.

Ten people had been rescued and another three were believed to be missing, Greece’s coast guard said.

Two coast guard patrol boats, a vessel from the European border agency Frontex, one helicopter and two aircraft, as well as a vessel that had been sailing nearby, were involved in the search operation, the coast guard said. Turkey’s coast guard had also been informed of the incident.

According to the Greek coast guard, the dinghy appeared to have sunk inside Turkish territorial waters, with initially one survivor swimming into Greek territorial waters and being picked up by Greek authorities. Another nine people were then rescued from inside Turkish territorial waters, they said.

ADVERTISEMENT

Survivors told authorities there had been a total of 13 people on the dinghy when it sank. Their nationalities weren’t immediately available.

Speaking in parliament, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Turkey failed to rescue the passengers “as it should have done inside Turkish territorial waters and the Greek coast guard, which puts the protection of human life above all, was forced to enter Turkish territorial waters, rescuing 10 people.”

Greece has for years been one of the most popular entry points into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The vast majority attempt to reach Greek islands near the Turkish coast, often in dangerously overcrowded inflatable dinghies and unseaworthy boats.

Mitarachi stressed that Greece was protecting its borders and that entries by migrants heading from the Turkish coast to the Greek islands were 96% lower in the last 12 months compared with the previous 12-month period.

Rights groups and migrants have repeatedly accused Greece of carrying out illegal summary deportations of people who arrive on the islands without giving them the chance to apply for asylum. Greek authorities vehemently deny they carry out pushbacks, but do say they robustly patrol the borders.

“The government’s policy is clear. We do not want to be the gateway for smuggling networks into the European Union,” Mitarachi said. “We have denied hundreds of millions of euros from the smugglers of human pain, who operate to the east of our country. Our country has land and sea borders.”

The Mexican man was found by agents on the U.S. side after the June 16 fall, which left him with severe injuries to his leg. He was taken to a hospital in Harlingen, Texas, where he also tested positive for the coronavirus.

He underwent two surgeries for his injuries, but never regained consciousness after going under anesthesia. He was removed from life support on Friday and was pronounced dead by hospital staff.

He was still on hospital watch by Border Patrol agents at the time, and so he is designated a death in custody.

The man, whose name wasn’t released by authorities, is the latest in a growing list of deaths amid the border surge that began with the new Biden administration.

Drownings, car crashes and exposure to the elements are all taking a larger toll than usual with the higher numbers of border jumpers.

The wall is also part of the deadly equation, with migrants slipping or, in some cases, being tossed from the heights of the barrier.

A farmer ran over one of the hiding migrants, killing him.

Sheriff’s deputies responded to a call concerning suspected migrants on State Highway 55 on Friday morning. Nolasco says he saw two suspected migrants run into a farm field to avoid capture. One appeared to be a child around eight years old.

Tragically, one suspected migrant was killed after he was accidentally run over by a combine tractor as he hid from authorities, officials stated.

Sheriff Nolasco notified the Border Patrol to begin a search for the missing eight-year-old suspected migrant in hopes that the same fate would not await the child. A search involving the Uvalde County Sheriff’s Office, Border Patrol, and Texas Game Wardens commenced in hopes of locating the child.

Sheriff Nolasco told Breitbart Texas the child and another migrant were found safe in an adjacent farm. The accident victim was pronounced dead by a Uvalde justice of the peace at 12:42 pm on Friday. No identification was located on the body.

The area is near a railroad line that travels from the border area to San Antonio, Texas. Migrants frequently board trains in this area in order to avoid detection and arrest by the Border Patrol. This may have been the case for the suspected migrant killed in the accident.

Officials report an uptick in migrants boarding trains in Uvalde County. Border Patrol agents are discovering at times, more migrants concealed on a single day than were found in an entire month in years past. In June, one train was found to have more than 50 migrants concealed in the train cars and engine.

For those discovered near Uvalde, most do not use the train to cross the international border. They typically cross on foot near Eagle Pass and walk to rail yards. They ultimately climb on northbound rail cars to circumvent inland Border Patrol checkpoints."

The causes of death for the two men, who were both foreign nationals, were not immediately known.

The Rio Grande Valley sees more than 2,000 apprehensions of migrants a day, making it one of the most popular areas where migrants try to cross into the U.S. illegally.

There has been a migrant surge so far in 2021, with 188,829 migrant encounters at the southern border reported in June by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), nearly double the 104,311 number encountered in the same month in 2019. Only 33,049 migrants were encountered in June of last year at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic

Migration numbers have historically dipped in the summer months due to the heat, but CBP is currently still seeing surging numbers.

""We are in the hottest part of the summer, and we are seeing a high number of distress calls to CBP from migrants abandoned in treacherous terrain by smugglers with no regard for human life,"" CBP acting Commissioner Troy Miller said in a statement last week.

""Although CBP does everything it can to locate and rescue individuals who are lost or distressed, the bottom line is this: The terrain along the border is extreme, the summer heat is severe, and the miles of desert migrants must hike after crossing the border in many areas are unforgiving,"" Miller said.

The increased numbers are partly due to an order put in place by the Trump administration that allows the government to rapidly expel most migrants, leading to many of them being encountered multiple times."

Let me try to clear up some confusion. Some are asking if people have had the vaccine, why are they getting Covid? The short answer is, they aren't. There are two components to this pandemic. SARS CoV 2 (virus) and Covid-19 (disease). The media is using these two as interchangeable, but they are not. Think of it this way. HIV is the virus that can progress to AIDS, which is the disease that causes death. SARS is the virus that can progress to Covid, which is the disease that causes hospitalizations/death. A vaccinated person can contract the SARS virus, but there is a 96% chance it won't progress to Covid. If you are vaccinated and test positive for the virus,(falsely named 'Covid' test) you will most likely have symptoms for a few days and then be fine. I think the mistake was made when it was called a Covid-19 test, instead of a SARS CoV 2 test. The two are not interchangeable because they are different progressions. Does that make sense?"

A migrant was found dead late last month on a rugged hillside a few miles north of the border, local and federal authorities confirmed this week.

A volunteer search-and-rescue organization alerted authorities to the 33-year-old man’s death around 2:45 p.m. June 30, according to statements from the U.S. Border Patrol and Medical Examiner’s Office.

Personnel from the Sheriff’s Department were sent in search of the body; an ASTREA helicopter crew helped locate it, sheriff’s spokesperson Lt. Amber Baggs said in a statement.

According to the Medical Examiner’s Office, the body was on a mountain just north of Otay Mountain Truck Trail, a few miles north of the border and southwest of Dulzura.

“The decedent is believed to be a missing person from Mexico seen crossing the U.S./Mexico border with a group of other border crossers,” the Medical Examiner’s Office said in a statement.

The man’s name was not released because his family had not yet been notified of his death, a county spokesperson said Friday.

Baggs said deputies wrote an incident report documenting that they had found the body, then turned the investigation over to the Medical Examiner’s Office. That agency is now handling the investigation and said in a statement that the man’s cause and manner of death are both pending."

Lo hizo como parte de lo que hace cada día cuando los alumnos la necesitan, sin conocer de ellos nada más allá de lo esencial. Poco después, el abuelo del muchacho la contactó para donarle un millón de dólares anualmente durante cinco años, como agradecimiento.

– La académica hondureña imparte clases de ingeniería estática e introducción a la ingeniería mecánica y nuclear.

– La pandemia abrió más oportunidades, nos ha enseñado que muchas cosas se pueden lograr con un clic.

Así ocurren hechos sorprendentes en el entorno de la científica Karla Mossi, quien cree firmemente en la educación y la solidaridad como las plataformas más sólidas de avanzar en la vida con buen pie.

“Mi padre me envió a estudiar a Estados Unidos, quería que me preparara y luego regresará a Honduras, pero no fue posible porque las oportunidades estaban aquí, él siempre soñó con un mejor país y creyó que nosotros podríamos contribuir a que lo fuera”, contó la científica hondureña Karla Margarita Mossi, directora del doctorado en Ingeniería Mecánica y Nuclear de la Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) en Estados Unidos (EE. UU.).

La VCU, es una de las universidades más renombradas de la nación norteamericana por ser de las primeras autorizadas para ofrecer el doctorado en Ingeniería Mecánica y Nuclear, que es dirigido por esta mujer, cuyos orígenes yacen en la capital de Honduras, Tegucigalpa, un lugar que recuerda con nostalgia porque asegura, fue donde vivió una de las mejores épocas de su vida.

Amante de las causas justas

Ella no pierde el rumbo, no olvida de donde viene y hacia dónde va, recuerda a Honduras como un país noble con grandes riquezas, pero donde falta invertir en educación; tanto así que, en su agenda, siempre hay espacio para atender a los estudiantes especialmente aquellos con limitadas posibilidades económicas, pero con grandes cualidades para sobresalir, su día no termina sin antes identificar las barreras que podrían impedir que alguien logre sus objetivos.

Karla es el ángel para miles de estudiantes migrantes en los Estados Unidos, tiene un buen ojo para detectar a los que tienen sueños y deseos de triunfar en la vida. No se siente una mujer exitosa, pero sí comprometida con las causas justas, su meta es seguir abriendo ventanas de oportunidades para aquellos que no tienen más que ilusiones de superación. Su condición humana hace que no le dé reparo pedir ayuda a los demás, su estilo de vida es la transparencia, eso le permite manejar importantes fondos que sirven a quienes en verdad lo necesitan.

Estudió en Honduras

De su padre, don Mauricio Mossi, recuerda que era exigente, celoso y muy responsable, mientras su madre, una mujer comprensiva, amiga y capaz, – “era mi compañera de vida, le gustaba el diálogo y sobre todo la tranquilidad, aún recuerdo cuando fui a la universidad, me llevó y me esperó, sabía que era tímida, ella me conocía bien, me ayudó a superar muchos obstáculos en la vida, gracias a ellos pude salir adelante”.

La doctora Mossi contó en una amplia conversación con Proceso Digital que creció en la colonia Humuya de la capital hondureña y en Instituto Politécnico Educacional de esa comunidad, realizó su primaria, en un entorno sencillo donde nunca le sobró nada. Muy orgullosa recuerda que vivió con lo necesario, su abuelo era granjero, pero desciende de personas visionarias y comprometidas, “nos enseñaron a creer y confiar en nosotros”, apostilló al tiempo de reiterar que la apuesta en todos sus ancestros fue educar para la vida.

Realizó su bachillerato en ciencias y letras en el Colegio Sagrado Corazón de Jesús, posteriormente ingresó a la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH), obtuvo el grado de ingeniera mecánica industrial. “Ella – su mamá-, no quería que estudiara esa carrera porque antes se tenía la percepción que terminaría arreglando carros”, comentó.

Una joven soñadora

En su adolescencia, Karla no tenía idea exacta de lo que quería ser, sólo sabía que le gustaban las matemáticas, pero tuvo la dicha de que un tío -Oscar Reyes-, psicólogo de profesión, le orientó en un momento oportuno, – “me hizo un examen de aptitud y el resultado fue que tenía vocación para la mecánica, yo en realidad desconocía de qué se trataba, pero ahora vivo agradecida con él, por ese fortuito apoyo y esa enorme orientación”, contó.

Tras egresar de la UNAH, motivada por su padre don Mauricio y su madre Emilia, envió muchas cartas a universidades del exterior, donde solicitaba un cupo para estudiar, en ese entonces la posición socioeconómica de su familia había mejorado y eso le permitía tener más aspiraciones, mismas que pudo concretar con más de ocho años de estudios, – “en su momento lo vi como un sacrificio, pero ahora veo que valió la pena”, – dijo.

Karla Mossi se graduó de Ingeniera Mecánica Industrial en la UNAH, viajó a Estados Unidos donde obtuvo su maestría y posteriormente su doctorado en la Universidad de Old Dominion en Norfolk, Virginia.

Y es que entre esas cartas a las universidades estaban sus sueños plasmados, sin tener la certeza de que podía hacerlos realidad. “Hoy que el tiempo ha pasado, veo que lo que aprendí en la escuela, en el colegio y sobre todo en la UNAH, fue lo que me respaldó aquí para continuar con mi preparación, pero la base para estudiar la logré en Honduras”, recalcó.

Un padre estricto y celoso

Al matizar sus logros con el ambiente familiar entrañable en el que creció, ella recuerda que, su padre quería que tuviera otra perspectiva de las cosas, él creía que debíamos salir del país, por eso, todos tuvimos la oportunidad de estudiar fuera, sabiendo que eso conlleva un esfuerzo propio, no todo estaba ahí, – “nos tocó poner nuestra propia parte, mi padre quería que llegara lejos, él fue estricto en todo, pero tenía razón en muchas cosas”.

Estudió inglés en el Instituto Hondureño de Cultura Interamericana (IHCI) en Tegucigalpa, esto mientras esperaba que una de sus tantas solicitudes enviadas a universidades de EE. UU. respondiera, con el tiempo fue aceptada en dos de ellas: la Universidad Católica de Washington y la Universidad Old Dominion de Norfolk (1988), no fue fácil, externó.

Recordó que su papá estaba emocionado, ya que él quería que fuera en la Universidad Católica para que viviera con las monjas, sin embargo “fuimos a las dos y decidimos por la más barata, donde me condicionaron que debía mejorar las calificaciones para optar a una beca y así sucedió, con orgullo puedo contar que un día llamé a casa para decirle a mi mamá que ya no me enviaran más dinero porque me habían dado una beca”.

Una vida de academia e investigación

En efecto las notas habían mejorado, eso acaparó la atención de uno de sus maestros, quien le preguntó ¿tienes beca? y le dije que no, entonces me dijo: ¿Por qué? Al conocer su respuesta le indicó cómo aplicar a un beneficio estudiantil, él se convirtió en un apoyo fundamental. “Yo no tenía carro, él me llevaba a la NASA a uno de mis primeros trabajos como voluntaria, respondí con buen rendimiento, estudiantil y laboral”.

Además de la docencia y la investigación sobre materiales inteligentes híbridos, promueve un programa de becas entre estudiantes que llegan a Estados Unidos en busca de una oportunidad, entre ellos varios jóvenes hondureños que ella considera tienen la suficiente capacidad para sobresalir, – “estoy conversando con ellos, espero poderlos convencer para que se vengan, si se preparan pueden lograr cosas importantes”, externó con ilusión.

Karla Mossi es de esas mujeres que inició su camino al éxito con entrega y pasión, hoy en día, la vida le sonríe porque hace lo que más le gusta, sin embargo, reconoce que para llegar a donde está, se necesita sacrificio, dedicación, compromiso y vocación. “En la vida he conocido personas inteligentes, siempre he creído que hay gente valiosa en el país, pero necesitan aspirar a más, el mundo tiene muchas oportunidades”.

Aprendió de sus errores

Orgullosa de sus raíces, cuenta como su familia se mueve con humildad en los caminos del éxito, pero sin olvidar el sacrificio con el que sus padres les pusieron a estudiar. A ella y a sus dos hermanos, “mis padres decían que quien estudia encuentra progreso, siempre dijeron que las metas se logran despacio”.

La científica tienen más de 25 años de laborar como docente en Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU).

Tras 20 años trabajando como académica, sostiene que para triunfar hay que soñar, recuerda que superó no uno, sino muchos obstáculos, entre ellos la timidez y el miedo; ahora es una mujer segura de sí misma, con un corazón enorme para ayudar a aquellos estudiantes con limitadas posibilidades económicas, pero con grandes deseos de salir adelante, con una atención preferencial para los migrantes.

Recordó que estando en la universidad, la aplazaron en una de sus clases y que eso no fue motivo de frustración, sino que, al contrario, como un impulso para hacer las cosas mejor, – “yo vi mis fallas como una oportunidad de mejora, creo que ese tipo de actitud frente a las variadas caídas es lo que me ha sacados adelante”.

El estudio antes que la política

En su vida como estudiante se encontró con buenos y malos maestros, sin embargo de todos aprendió algo, – “de los malos aprendí a sobrevivir, a aprender solo, a saber qué es lo que no se tiene que hacer cuando se es profesor, en Honduras me pasó, es por eso que creo que cada día, de cada persona tenemos algo que aprender”.

Recomendó a los jóvenes de Honduras, a buscar oportunidades correctas, ya que hay muchas en el mundo, les pidió no perder el tiempo.

La científica considera que ya es tiempo que, en Honduras, haya maestrías para las ingenierías, por ejemplo, una que está teniendo bastante demanda en Estados Unidos, es la ingeniería en conducción de empresas, no es administración, sino algo más técnico, que tiene que ver con el funcionamiento de raíz de una organización. “Se pueden implementar, no tienen que ser muy largas, pero crean, que con algo así la gente piensa distinto”.

Karla Mossi disfruta los momentos en familia con su esposo Gary y su hijo de 14 años Dante.

Las oportunidades se buscan

Pidió a las nuevas generaciones, ver la vida desde mejores ángulos, de manera que haya una reflexión sobre el contexto, ya que cualquiera que sea su posición, hay que ver los obstáculos como oportunidades para avanzar, porque al final lo que cuenta es la capacidad, sin importar la edad, el género o la raza, – “terminemos la exclusión, todos merecemos una oportunidad, recordemos que educación inicia en casa”, dijo con convicción.

Remarcó que el futuro de las personas y de la sociedad está en el estudio, – “por eso agradezco a mis padres porque nos enseñaron a todos por igual, no había preferencia en casa, yo debía lavar los platos, pero también lo podían hacer mis hermanos… lo que hace falta es que las familias hondureñas le apuesten al estudio a largo plazo”.

Reconoció que en Honduras las oportunidades, aún para los egresados de la academia, son limitadas porque ha conocido historias de hondureños que se graduaron de ingenieros o tienen un título universitario y como no encontraron un trabajo decidieron irse de manera irregular para los EE. UU. donde ganan sueldos súper bajos, sé que todos lo hacen por desesperación, ante tanta falta de esperanza y paciencia.

Ama de casa, maestra y científica

“Nada es gratis, para mí la lotería no existe, si se la ganan está bien, lo único que nos puede sacar adelante es el trabajo arduo, esas son mentalidades que tenemos que ir cambiando para lograr metas, objetivos y sueños, para ello hay que ser buen ciudadano, no podemos seguirnos quejando, si nunca me he molestado para ir votar y elegir, hay que expresarnos si queremos cambios, hay que pelear desde lo más sencillo, para que nadie nos imponga”, reflexionó la académica.

“Una persona que se eduque puede hacer mucho por un país, aun cuando falten las oportunidades” -dice Karla-, quien todos los días, madruga para atender a su familia, dejar a su hijo en la escuela, llegar al laboratorio donde realiza las investigaciones al tiempo que enseña en las aulas universitarias y, su día no termina sin ayudar y atender a los estudiantes.

Tras graduarse en la UNAH estudió inglés en Tegucigalpa y ocho años mas para su maestría y doctorado en EEUU.

Una inimaginable recompensa

Siempre está gestionando ayudas para los estudiantes, porque sabe lo que significa una beca para las personas de escasos recursos con ganas de triunfar en la vida. Entre esas actividades se encontró con un joven que necesitaba ayuda cuando se enfermó, ella estuvo ahí para arrimar su hombro, con el tiempo descubrió que ese estudiante era un multimillonario, por ello su abuelo nos mostró su agradecimiento por el trato que le dimos en la universidad.

“Entonces decidió donarnos un millón de dólares por cinco años, para que pudiéramos otorgar becas a estudiantes que vengan de otros países, incluso costó mucho lograr que la universidad permitiera la donación, no sabía cómo otorgarlas y consulté a varios de ellos ¿para que ocuparían dinero en caso de tenerlo? y me encantaron las historias, porque ahí se conocen todos los sacrificios que hacen sus padres para poder venir.

También tienen otro medio millón de dólares que lo destinaron para estudiantes que quieran sacar una maestría o un doctorado, “me acaban de dar ese dinero, es como un sueño hecho realidad, lo solicité y jamás me imaginé que me iban a decir que sí, yo disfruto ayudar a quienes tienes muchas barreras para estudiar, especialmente a los que vienen de otros países quienes sufren más que los que nacen aquí”.

Ayudar a los demás es mi otra pasión

A mi hijo siempre le recuerdo cuando vamos a Honduras, que es una persona privilegiada, porque vive en un país de múltiples oportunidades y no usarlas es un crimen para mí, le insisto para que siga practicando tenis, porque le digo que lo único que yo podía jugar cuando era niña, era subirme a un árbol porque no había más que hacer en ese tiempo. En mi universidad saben que vengo de uno de los países más pobres de Latinoamérica

Karla Mossi ascendió peldaño a peldaño en su vida académica y ahora desde la ciencia representa un un orgullo para el país y un apoyo para mucho estudiantes a los que se brinda sin límites.

Disfruto mucho saber que soy una persona que tiene que ver con el éxito de ellos, esto me da mucho placer, incluso más que el dinero, el dinero no me dará esa satisfacción jamás, ahora estoy gestionando más ayudas y con certeza puedo decir que hay muchas personas interesadas en ayudar a quienes desean estudiar aquí en Estados Unidos.

Los aportes de la energía nuclear

Experta en su campo y comprometida con el bienestar del planeta desde su óptica científica ella recuerda que la energía nuclear está dejando aportes importantes al mundo, es una industria que está cambiando y ganando más espacios en el planeta tierra, además produce menos daños al ambiente con relación a la energía producida por los carburantes, hay avances importantes como hacer paneles solares que no sean tan dañinos al medio ambiente.

Con la energía nuclear, se trata el cáncer, con la radiación se calma el dolor para quienes sufren este padecimiento y para las personas que tienen un tumor, les permite que, en los últimos meses de su vida, haya menos dolor, incluso en algunos casos hasta se puede curar, vemos como en el campo de la medicina, esta ciencia es muy importante, externó.

En este orden agregó que, la energía nuclear busca proteger a las personas que van al espacio, porque de lo contrario al entrar en contacto con esa radiación, regresarían a la tierra solo a morir. “Sé que la usan en el Centro de Cáncer Emma Romero de Callejas y en el Hospital General San Felipe, ahí hacen un buen trabajo”.

La científica hondureña dirige un programa de becas para migrantes en la Virginia Commonwealth University de EEUU.

Honduras entre sus proyectos

Ahora promueve varias becas para estudiantes en Honduras, -dice Karla Mossi -, esto tras conocer el programa HonduFuturo, que tienen varios requisitos, pero uno importante es que deben regresar al país para trabajar y si logran dar clases en una universidad, entonces ellos no deben nada, para eso deben saber inglés, he ido a exponer para poder tener más solicitantes de Honduras en universidades de los EE. UU.

Aprovechó para recomendar a la empresa privada hondureña, involucrarse más en proyectos educativos, de manera que haya opciones de trabajo y estudio; para que haya un beneficio mutuo, sin descuidar que hay buenos académicos, pero los jóvenes deben concentrarse en estudiar, la academia en Honduras hace un buen trabajo, de eso no me queda ninguna duda.

“Hay mucho potencial en Honduras, espero un día se pueda desarrollar, era el sueño de mi papá y también el mío, para ello hay que ser perseverante, sacrificarse un poco más y habrá resultados exitosos”, concluyó. JP"

Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) assigned to the Tucson Border Patrol Station travelled eastbound on SR 86 attempting to locate the vehicle. A CBP Air and Marine Operations (AMO) helicopter crew responded to the area and located the vehicle travelling eastbound on SR 86. The AMO helicopter crew provided aerial surveillance of the vehicle providing updates as to its location to BPAs on the ground. The AMO pilot observed the Jeep Liberty drive erratically through several red lights as it continued into Tucson, AZ. The vehicle then entered onto northbound I-19, which is approximately 24 miles east of the SR 86 checkpoint.

The AMO pilot continued to monitor the vehicle as it merged onto westbound I-10. A National Guard helicopter relieved the AMO helicopter crew near Marana, AZ, and continued the aerial surveillance of the vehicle.

With the assistance of air support, BPAs located the vehicle on I-10. At approximately 7:57 PM, a BPA attempted to stop the Jeep Liberty by deploying a Vehicle Immobilization Device (VID) on I-10, approximately 39 miles northwest of Tucson near Picacho Peak. The driver of the Jeep Liberty lost control, crossed the median and struck a tractor trailer in the eastbound lanes of travel. As a result of the impact, the vehicle traveled back into the median and caught fire. BPAs immediately requested emergency medical services (EMS), pulled several occupants from the vehicle, and rendered aid. There was a total of eleven occupants in the vehicle, to include two unidentified individuals who were declared deceased on the scene.

Life Flight EMS responded to the scene and transported two individuals to the Banner University Medical Center Main Campus (BUMC-Main), to include an unidentified male individual, who was later pronounced deceased by medical personnel. Six individuals were transported via ground ambulance to BUMC-Main. One individual was transported to the Tucson Coordination Center (TCC) but subsequently transported to BUMC-South Campus for evaluation.

This incident is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and reviewed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Professional Responsibility.

North America,2021-08-02,1.0,,1,,,1.0,,El Salvador,Central America,Mixed or unknown,United States of America,US-Mexico border crossing,"Approximately 17 miles south of Eagle Pass, near Highway 277, Maverick County, Texas, USA",https://archive.ph/vMW0V,5,"The following statement pertains to an in-custody death that occurred near Eagle Pass, TX, on Monday, August 2, 2021. This information is based on a preliminary review and may be corrected or updated in the future. Additional information may also be released by other agencies investigating this incident.

On August 2, 2021, Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) were alerted to the presence of a group of suspected undocumented migrants inside a ranch approximately 17 miles south of Eagle Pass, Texas near Highway 277. BPAs assigned to the Eagle Pass South (EGS) Border Patrol Station responded and began tracking the group of migrants. After approximately nine hours of tracking the group, BPAs located and apprehended seven migrants while several other individuals fled. BPAs continued to search for these individuals.

Shortly thereafter, BPAs apprehended five more migrants, to include a male citizen of El Salvador. The man was initially handcuffed together with two other migrants using two sets of handcuffs. The man reportedly became unruly and was causing discomfort to the other two individuals to whom he was attached. When BPAs removed the handcuffs to separate him from the others, he attempted to escape, running a short distance before being apprehended again by BPAs. BPAs restrained him with his hands behind his back and placed him on the hood of a nearby Border Patrol vehicle. BPAs placed two other migrants on the front bumper area of the vehicle and two in the rear of the vehicle and drove back to the location where the first group was apprehended to await a transport vehicle.

Upon arrival at that location, BPAs removed all the migrants from the Border Patrol vehicle to await the transport vehicle; the El Salvadoran man remained restrained. When the Border Patrol transport vehicle arrived approximately one hour later, BPAs discovered the man was unresponsive. The BPAs began chest compressions and requested emergency medical services. When the Eagle Pass Fire Department arrived on the scene, medical personnel determined the man was deceased.

Consistent with agency procedures for reviewing in-custody deaths, CBP OPR immediately responded to the scene, interviewed migrants involved in the incident, and subsequently notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DHS Office of Inspector General, and the Dimmit County Sheriff’s Department. The Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office and CBP OPR are reviewing this incident which is under investigation by the Texas Rangers. CBP is fully cooperating with all agencies reviewing or investigating this incident.

All CBP personnel involved in the incident have been reassigned to non-field enforcement activities, pending the results of the investigation and subsequent actions that may be warranted. Additionally, U.S. Border Patrol has initiated a full review of their transport and detention procedures to assure they are fully compliant with the CBP Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) policy."

Jeudi 12 août 2021, le centre régional opérationnel de surveillance et de sauvetage (CROSS) Gris-Nez est informé que plusieurs embarcations de migrants se trouvent en difficulté dans le détroit du Pas-de-Calais.

Vers 10h00, le CROSS Gris-Nez est contacté par le cargo Elena qui reporte une embarcation d'une quarantaine de migrants en difficulté, dont certaines personnes se trouvent à la mer, à environ 13 nautiques (environ 24km) au large de Dunkerque.

Il met en œuvre un dispositif de recherche et de sauvetage composé de nombreux moyens pour leur porter assistance :

les navires de pêche Nicolas Jérémy et Notre Dame de Boulogne se trouvant à proximité ;

les navires de pêche et se trouvant à proximité ; le fast rescue boat (FRB) du cargo Elena ;

le fast rescue boat (FRB) du cargo ; l'hélicoptère NH90 de l'armée de l'air belge ;

l'hélicoptère NH90 de l'armée de l'air belge ; le patrouilleur de service public (PSP) Flamant de la Marine nationale ;

le patrouilleur de service public (PSP) de la Marine nationale ; l'embarcation de sûreté maritime et portuaire (ESMP) du peloton de sûreté maritime et portuaire (PSMP) de Dunkerque.

Arrivé sur zone, l'hélicoptère NH90 de l'armée de l'air belge informe le CROSS que l'embarcation est en train de couler et qu'il y aurait potentiellement plusieurs hommes à la mer. L'hélicoptère treuille plusieurs naufragés à son bord et les dépose à bord du Flamant et sur les 2 navires de pêche. D'autres naufragés sont également récupérés par le Nicolas Jérémy et le Notre Dame de Boulogne.

L'embarcation de sauvetage du cargo Elena récupère une personne inconsciente et la transfère à bord du Flamant. Le CROSS initie une conférence téléphonique avec le centre de consultation médicale maritime (CCMM) de Toulouse et le SAMU de coordination maritime médicale (SCMM) du Havre (76). Une évacuation médicale est préconisée. Le CROSS engage l'hélicoptère NH90 de l'armée de l'air belge pour procéder à l'évacuation. Le naufragé est hélitreuillé à bord de l'hélicoptère et déposé à l'hôpital de Calais où il a été pris en charge par les équipes médicales.

Le Flamant récupère à son bord l'ensemble des naufragés et fait route vers le port de Dunkerque (59) où les naufragés seront pris en charge par le service départemental d'incendie et de secours (SDIS) 59 et la police aux frontières (PAF) 59.

D'autres opérations de sauvetage sont toujours en cours sous la coordination du CROSS Gris-Nez. L'hélicoptère Dauphin de la Marine nationale a été engagé par le CROSS Gris-Nez pour relever l'hélicoptère NH90 de l'armée de l'air belge pour continuer les opérations de recherche et sauvetage en mer. Le bilan est en cours de consolidation. Il sera communiqué ultérieurement dans la journée.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Thousands of Afghans rushed into Kabul’s main airport Monday, some so desperate to escape the Taliban that they held onto a military jet as it took off and plunged to their deaths. At least seven people died in the chaos, U.S. officials said, as America’s longest war ended with its enemy the victor.

The crowds came while the Taliban enforced their rule over the capital of 5 million people after a lightning advance across the country that took just over a week to dethrone the country’s Western-backed government. There were no major reports of abuses or fighting, but many residents stayed home and remained fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted.

A resolute U.S. President Joe Biden said he stood “squarely behind” his decision to withdraw American forces and acknowledged the “gut-wrenching” images unfolding in Kabul. Biden said he faced a choice between honoring a previously negotiated withdrawal agreement or sending thousands more troops back to begin a third decade of war.

“After 20 years, I’ve learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces,” Biden said in a televised address from the White House.

The president said American troops should not be fighting and dying in a war “that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.” He warned the Taliban not to interfere with the evacuation efforts.

Across Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in the fighting. Security forces and politicians handed over their provinces and bases without a fight, likely believing the two-decade Western experiment to remake Afghanistan would not survival the resurgent Taliban. The last American troops had planned to withdraw at the end of the month.

“The world is following events in Afghanistan with a heavy heart and deep disquiet about what lies ahead,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.

As the U.S. military and others continued evacuation flights, Afghans swarmed over the international airport’s tarmac. Some climbed into aircraft parked on the taxiway, while others dangled precariously off a jet bridge.

U.S. troops took positions to guard the active runway, but the crowd stormed past them and their armored vehicles. Gunshots rang out. As one U.S. Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III tried to take off, a helicopter did low runs in front of it to try to drive people off the runway.

Videos showed a group of Afghans hanging onto the plane just before takeoff and several falling through the air as the airplane rapidly gained altitude over the city.

Senior American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation, told The Associated Press that the chaos left seven dead, including several who fell from the flight. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. forces killed two people he described as carrying weapons in the melee. He said 1,000 more U.S. troops would be deployed to secure the airfield and back up the 2,500 already there.

All flights at the airport — both military and civilian — were halted until Afghan civilians could be cleared from the runway, Kirby added.

Late Monday night, hundreds of people remained trapped between American forces trying to push them out of the airport and Taliban forces trying to keep them in, witnesses said. An Associated Press journalist also saw what appeared to be an airstrike target two vehicles near the airport.

Earlier, more than 300 people were evacuated aboard a Turkish Airlines flight after Turkish soldiers cleared the runway. Senol Celik, who identified himself as a Turkish Embassy employee, said people “threw themselves in front of the plane.”

“They wanted to board the plane. They wanted to escape Afghanistan,” he said. “We were afraid that the plane would return and that we would enter that chaos. We were sad for those people.”

Shafi Arifi, who had a ticket to travel to Uzbekistan on Sunday, was unable to board his plane because it was packed with people who raced across the tarmac and climbed aboard, with no police or airport staff in sight.

“There was no room for us to stand,” said the 24-year-old. “Children were crying, women were shouting, young and old men were so angry and upset, no one could hear each other. There was no oxygen to breathe.”

After a woman fainted and was carried off the plane, Arifi gave up and returned home.

Other Afghans, like Rakhmatula Kuyash, are also trying to leave through land border crossings, all of which are now controlled by the Taliban.

“I’m lost and I don’t know what to do,” said Kuyash, who crossed into Uzbekistan on Sunday after leaving his children and relatives in Afghanistan. “I left everything behind.”

Others were not so lucky. Uzbekistan air defenses shot down an Afghan military aircraft that tried to enter the country without permission. The two pilots were reportedly injured and in custody

Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani, who earlier left the country, faced Russian allegations he fled Kabul with four cars and a helicopter full of cash. His whereabouts remained unclear.

The U.S. Embassy has been evacuated and the American flag lowered, with diplomats relocating to the airport to help with the evacuation. Other Western countries also closed their missions and were flying out staff and their citizens.

In interviews with U.S. television networks, national security adviser Jake Sullivan blamed the Afghan military for the Taliban’s rapid takeover, saying it lacked the will to fight.

The Taliban offensive stunned American officials . Just days before the insurgents entered Kabul with little if any resistance, a U.S. military assessment predicted it could take months for the capital to fall.

The rout threatened to erase 20 years of Western efforts to remake Afghanistan that saw tens of thousands of Afghans killed as well as more than 3,500 U.S. and allied troops . The initial invasion in 2001 drove the Taliban from power and scattered al-Qaida, which had planned the 9/11 attacks while being sheltered in Afghanistan.

Under the Taliban, which ruled in accordance with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, women were largely confined to their homes and suspected criminals faced amputation or public execution. The insurgents have sought to project greater moderation in recent years, but many Afghans remain skeptical

Filippo Grandi, the United Nations’ high commissioner for refugees, separately described interactions with the Taliban as “relatively positive.”

On Monday, Nillan, a 27-year-old resident of Kabul who asked to be identified only by her first name for fear of reprisals, said she did not see a single woman out on the streets during a 15-minute drive, “only men and boys.”

“It feels like time has stopped. Everything’s changed,” she told the AP.

She added, “It feels like our life and our future has ended.”

Bangladesh Navy and the coast guard are still conducting rescue operations in the Bay of Bengal for the remaining victims

Bangladesh Coast Guard and police recovered 11 more bodies on the shores of Sandwip upazila in Chittagong, four days after a group of Rohingya refugees went missing in the Bay of Bengal.

As of Wednesday, local law enforcement recovered the bodies of 18 people, presumably victims of the same group of Rohingyas whose trawler capsized Saturday due to bad weather in the sea as they tried to flee from Bashan Char.

Between Monday and Tuesday, police and the coast guard recovered six bodies—four women, one child and one man—after they washed up in the same area.

These bodies were recovered from Sarikait, Santoshpur, Bauria, Magadhara and other coastal areas of the upazila.

Confirming the matter, Coast Guard East Zone Zonal Commander Captain Kazi Shah Alam, said: “The ocean tide washed ashore 11 more bodies, including six children, four women and one man, on Wednesday.”

Similar to prior bodies recovered, they are being taken to Bhashan Char for identification, he added.

“Instigated by unethical brokers, they tried to escape their accommodation in Bhashan Char by crossing the Bay of Bengal in a small boat, which is why such an accident occurred,” he also added.

Earlier on Sunday afternoon, the coast guard recovered the body of a 12-year-old child from 10 to 12 nautical miles south of Bhashan char after a trawler carrying around 40 Rohingya refugees capsized off the coast of Chittagong in the Bay of Bengal while fleeing from the Bhashan Char island early Saturday.

Some of them managed to save themselves by swimming to nearby fishing trawlers.

Circa 20 le persone tratte in salvo. Nelle scorse ore sono ripresi gli sbarchi a Lampedusa con tre imbarcazioni approdate sull'isola

Un gruppo di migranti si è gettato dal barcone in mare alla vista della costa dell'isola di Levanzo. Capitaneria di porto, Guardia di finanza e carabinieri hanno recuperato il cadavere di una persona, alcuni, non si conosce ancora il numero, risulterebbero dispersi. Una ventina le persone tratte in salvo. Nelle scorse ore sono ripresi gli sbarchi a Lampedusa , dalla scorsa mezzanotte sono 167 le persone migranti approdate e tre i barconi intercettati e soccorsi al largo dell'isola.

Le testimonianze

""Eravamo in 23 sulla barca e 22 sono state soccorse e messe in salvo"": è la testimonianza, univoca, raccolta da mediatori culturali dai migranti che si sono gettati in mare dal barcone in mare alla vista della costa, nell'isola di Levanzo, piccola isola delle Egadi del comune di Favignana, nel Trapanese. Non ci sarebbero dunque dispersi, ma una persona è annegata. Secondo la prima ricostruzione 16 migranti sono arrivati a terra e altri sette, compresa la vittima, recuperate in mare. Nella zona, a scopo precauzionale, sono ancora in corso ricerche da parte di capitaneria di porto, guardia di finanza e carabinieri.

Le ricerche in mare

Le ricerche in mare a Levanzo erano scattate dopo che un tunisino ha chiamato il Centro Operativo Nazionale della Guardia Costiera dicendo di trovarsi in mare nei pressi di una scogliera vicino Trapani insieme ad altri connazionali. Durante la telefonata i militari sono riusciti ad ottenere dal chiamante, attraverso le procedure di geolocalizzazione, una posizione geografica attendibile su cui far confluire i soccorsi. Localizzati all'isola di Levanzo, sono stati inviati sul posto due elicotteri, uno della Guardia Costiera e uno dell'Aeronautica Militare e due motovedette della Guardia Costiera. Queste ultime, individuavano i naufraghi e recuperato cinque persone dall'acqua (e non sei come si era appreso in un primo momento, ndr) ed un uomo privo di vita. Ulteriori ricerche in zona da parte dei carabinieri hanno permesso di individuare a terra tutte le altre 17 persone che facevano parte del gruppo arrivato a Levanzo. Le operazioni si sono concluse e non risultano migranti dispersi.

Gli sbarchi a Lampedusa

Durante la notte dopo due diversi soccorsi effettuati al largo dell'isola, due gruppi di persone sono stati portati nell'hotspot di contrada Imbriacola. Il primo barcone, con a bordo 57 persone provenienti dall'area sub-sahariana, è stato intercettato a circa 2 miglia dal porto di Lampedusa. Il secondo, di circa 10 metri, è stato bloccato da una motovedetta della guardia di finanza a 6 miglia e a bordo c'erano 55 uomini del Bangladesh e dell'Egitto. Nella giornata di ieri si sono registrati tre sbarchi a Lampedusa con un totale di 56 persone. Un terzo barcone, con a bordo 55 persone, è stato intercettato a 4 miglia a Sud Est da Lampedusa, a intercettare l'imbarcazione di 10 metri, trasbordando gli uomini che hanno detto di provenire dal Bangladesh, è stata la motovedetta Pv9 della Guardia di finanza.

Intercettati 4 migranti su un barcone

Quattro tunisini, su un barcone di circa 10 metri, sono stati intercettati dalla motovedetta Pv9 della Guardia di finanza a 6 miglia dalla costa di Lampedusa. Anche loro, dopo un primo triage sanitario effettuato sul molo Favarolo, sono stati trasferiti all'hotspot dove, al momento, ci sono 630 ospiti. Cinquanta dei presenti nel centro fra poco verranno trasferiti al porto e imbarcati sul traghetto di linea che giungerà all'alba di domani a Porto Empedocle."

Europe,2021-08-18,1.0,,1,,,1.0,1.0,Afghanistan,Southern Asia,Accidental death,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,"At the OYO Metropolitan Hotel in Blonk Street, Sheffield, UK",https://archive.ph/gr5cu,3,"Ministers are facing serious questions after a five-year-old boy whose family had recently fled the Taliban fell to his death from a ninth-floor hotel window in Sheffield.

On Thursday night, South Yorkshire police named the boy as Mohammed Munib Majeedi.

His family is understood to have arrived in Britain in recent weeks and was among a number of Afghan refugees temporarily housed at the £33-a-night Metropolitan hotel.

One hotel resident, who was an interpreter for the British in Afghanistan, said Mohammed’s father had worked at the UK embassy in Kabul. He said he heard the boy’s mother scream “my son, my son” after the child fell from the open window at about 2.30pm on Wednesday.

The Refugee Council called for the Home Office to launch an immediate investigation into the incident and whether any safeguarding assessments were carried out.

The Home Office had been told about safety concerns at the hotel, the Guardian has learned, leading to questions about why the government placed families from Afghanistan there despite the concerns local officials raised.



The Guardian has been told that the hotel was used for a short time last year as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, but several families from Afghanistan have been placed in the hotel in recent weeks under the Home Office’s scheme to rescue those fleeing the Taliban.

Concerns had been raised previously about the safety of the hotel and its windows, which can open very wide. One guest wrote on the hotel’s Facebook page in 2019 that the windows “opened so wide I was scared my children would fall out”. She added: “Please don’t stay at this dangerous hotel.”

The budget hotel, which is being used to accommodate Afghan refugees who assisted the British authorities in their own country, was described as “absolutely disgusting”, “grimy” and “dirty” in online reviews as recently as last month.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are extremely saddened by the tragic death of a child at a hotel in Sheffield. The police are providing support to the family while the investigation continues and we cannot comment further at this time.”

The former interpreter for the British in Afghanistan said: “I was in my room. I heard a sound, like I heard the body fall. His mother was in the room with him. She was screaming: ‘My son, my son.’

“When I came here [outside] I saw the ambulance and police.”

He said the family came to the UK three or four weeks ago, landing at Birmingham airport and then staying in Manchester during Covid quarantine. The family, including the parents, three boys and two girls, moved to the hotel in Sheffield three or four days ago, and the father was regarded as “the new guy” among Afghans staying there, he said.

The interpreter added: “If the dad is working for the Americans or the English, then their lives are in danger in Afghanistan. They came here to save their lives, they came for a new life here.”

He said in his own room the windows only opened a few inches. The eight to 10 Afghan families staying at the hotel were being moved to another hotel on Thursday afternoon, he said.

On Thursday night, South Yorkshire police named Mohammed and said in a statement: “His family have now formally identified him and they are being supported by our family liaison officers. We would ask that their privacy is respected at this time. Officers are appealing for anyone with information relating to the incident to come forward.”

Dan Jarvis, the mayor of the Sheffield city region, who served for the British army in Afghanistan, said he was “desperately saddened at the appalling news”. He added: “My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, who will be experiencing an unimaginable pain at present.”

Terry Fox, Leader of Sheffield city council, said: “I am absolutely heartbroken that a young boy has lost his life in this way. My deepest thoughts are with the family of little Mohammed, I can’t begin to imagine what they are going through. As a council we have been at the hotel to offer assistance and, in partnership with the police, will support the family in any way we possibly can. While details are still emerging and the police continue to investigate, it’s not appropriate for me to comment further, except to say that this is an incredibly sad time.”

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “This a terrible tragedy and our thoughts are with the family who have gone through so much trauma and suffering to reach the UK.

“It is vital the Home Office carry out an urgent investigation into what has happened so steps can be taken to quickly learn lessons. We don’t know the details of the incident but it is imperative that families who come from Afghanistan are given all the support they need and housed in appropriate accommodation. They are vulnerable and often very traumatised. There should always be safeguarding assessments carried out so steps are taken to ensure nobody, especially children, is put at risk.

“We know from our work the quality of hotel accommodation is variable and there have been cases when the welfare and needs of people seeking safety in our country have been overlooked. We hope this wasn’t the case on this occasion.”

Tourists who had booked to stay in the hotel earlier this month had complained online that their bookings were suddenly cancelled. One traveller said they were told by a receptionist on 4 August that the hotel was closing in order to accommodate refugees.

OYO Rooms, which owns the Metropolitan hotel, has been approached for comment."

EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – Juarez police continue looking for six underage girls from Central America who went missing from two migrant shelters in different parts of the city nearly a month ago.

Five of the minors – four from Guatemala and one from Honduras – walked off Casa YMCA in the Chaveña neighborhood south of Downtown on July 17, police said. Another Guatemalan girl left the Nohemy Alvarez Quillay shelter on July 25.

None of the girls have been located and the Crimes Against Women unit of the Chihuahua State Police is investigating the disappearances, said police spokesman Alejandro Rubalcava. All the missing young women are between the ages of 15 and 17.

Their photos have been distributed throughout the city including at migrant shelters, where authorities hope their countrymen can provide information on their whereabouts. On Wednesday, Border Report visited one such shelter, but no one knew anything about the missing teens.

The state police is actively looking for more than 120 missing women and children, according to its website

Border Report on Thursday reached out to Casa YMCA headquarters in Mexico City, but Community Development Director Silvia Perez said she did not know that any girls were missing.

The organization runs shelters from migrant teens in Tijuana, Juarez and Piedras Negras. They provide temporary housing, food, clothing, medical and psychological screenings, and other services for unaccompanied minors from Central America that arrive at the Mexican border.

Each home is run by a married couple and, in the past, the minors were allowed to leave the premises and come back. However, due to violence and other crime factors, the girls at the Juarez shelter were not allowed to leave the home, the organization says.

The state police urges anyone either in Mexico or the United States with information about the girls to call (011-52-656) 629-3300."

Aug 4 (Reuters) - Lithuania's interior ministry on Wednesday dismissed Belarusian reports that an Iraqi migrant had been found beaten to death after being turned away at the Lithuanian border, describing it as part of a ""hybrid war"" being waged by Minsk.

Lithuania has accused Belarus of manufacturing a refugee problem on its border in retaliation for European Union sanctions on President Alexander Lukashenko's government. Belarus denies doing so.

Lithuania has reported a surge in illegal border crossings from Belarus and accused Minsk of flying in migrants from abroad and sending them across the border.

Belarus announced an investigation into what it said was the death of an unnamed Iraqi migrant. The head of the Belarusian security council, Alexander Volfovich, said the man was beaten so badly that Belarusian border guards were unable to help him.

""This is a method of hybrid war, disinformation. There was no incident on the border this night, no use of power,"" said a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Interior ministry.

Lithuania has authorised its border guards to use force if necessary to turn migrants away.

""I would like to mention in the course of those two days, fortunately there were no situations where our border guard officers used any kind of force,"" Commander of the Lithuanian State Border Guard Service, Rustamas Liubajevas, told Reuters.

Liubajevas said reports of migrants being injured were ""fake news"" and said he knew about the allegation of the Iraqi migrant's death only from Belarusian media.

The European Union said last week it would consider sanctions against migrant smugglers and those involved in human trafficking to address a surge in ""irregular"" border crossings from Belarus. read more"

The BPA observed a Ford Expedition traveling northbound. He initially followed from a distance and saw the vehicle pull to the side of the road. As the BPA drew closer, the vehicle accelerated and proceeded north on NMSR 185. The BPA followed the Expedition without activating his emergency equipment and alerted BPAs at the checkpoint of the approaching vehicle.

At approximately 4:45 AM, the Expedition circumvented the checkpoint by driving around the traffic cones onto southbound lanes and continued northbound on NMSR 185 at a high rate of speed. The BPA activated his emergency equipment and attempted to stop the vehicle while an additional Border Patrol unit pursued the smuggler. The driver of the Expedition failed to yield and continued for approximately three miles until the driver lost control and crashed, which ejected several occupants from the vehicle. BPAs immediately requested emergency medical services (EMS) and rendered aid to the occupants.

Native Air EMS responded and airlifted four occupants, including a male citizen of Ecuador, to the University Medical Center (UMC) in El Paso, TX. Three occupants were transported by EMS to Mountain View Hospital in Las Cruces, and three other occupants with minor injuries were transported to Memorial Hospital in Las Cruces.

On August 11, 2021, UMC medical personnel conducted a brain flow study which determined the Ecuadorian man failed to show brain activity. Although the man initially was placed on a ventilator, the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner declared him deceased, and on August 12, 2021 the ventilator was removed and he succumbed to his injuries.

This incident is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, the New Mexico State Police, and reviewed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Professional Responsibility and the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was also notified.

The BPAs requested medical assistance from a local Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider.

Approximately 10 minutes later, EMS arrived and transported the man to the Yuma Regional Medical Center (YRMC) where he was admitted. On August 19, 2021, the man succumbed to his ailments while under hospital watch by CBP.

The local area is protected by a levee wall that separates the flood plain along the river from the city of Hidalgo, Texas. While the levee wall is over 20 feet tall on the river side, it is only capped by a four foot chain link fence on the Hidalgo side. A second Border Patrol Agent responded to the area to attempt to apprehend the migrants who were seen running away from the levee wall towards Hidalgo when he observed two females attempting to climb over the chain link portion of the levee wall. He immediately responded and helped them over the top of the fence. At that point the Border Patrol Agent reportedly observed two additional females who had fallen off the levee wall and landed over 20 feet below on the river side.

Border Patrol Agents immediately responded to assist the females and radioed for medical assistance. One of the two females who fell, a citizen of Honduras, was unresponsive. The Border Patrol Agents administered CPR to her until relieved by local Emergency Medical Services. EMS transported both females to a hospital in McAllen, Texas. After arriving at the hospital, the unresponsive female was pronounced deceased.

The Hidalgo Police Department, the Hidalgo County Medical Examiner and Coroner’s Office, the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office, and CBP OPR are reviewing this incident. The DHS Office of Inspector General was also notified.

In an interview with the Serbestiyet news website Sad El Delli said the incident took place on Tuesday. The group crossed to the Greek side of the river around at 1:00 a.m. and was detained at around 3:00 a.m. by Greek security forces. They stayed in detention for approximately eight hours and then were pushed back to Turkey.

“After the Greek security forces pushed us back to Turkey at around 11:00 a.m., an officer separated the women from the group and said, ‘You’re free to go, you can return to İstanbul if you want’,” El Delli recounted. “Then he ordered the gendarmes to throw us into the river in groups of five.”

According to El Delli’s account some of the gendarmes begged the officer not to make them throw the refugees into the river, but they were forced to after he made death threats. “Let them die,” the officer said according to El Delli, “just like our soldiers getting killed on the Syrian border. Let them die here.”

El Delli also claimed that the officer recorded the incident and said “Good bye” to them with a smile on his face.

El Delli says he saw two Syrians and one Afghan drown in the river. “I was about to drown [too]. I was saved by a Palestinian and an Afghan refugee,” he said.

Survivors were able to make it to the Greek side again. Tired, hungry and thirsty they decided to head for a Greek security post. After staying there for four or five hours, they were again sent back to Turkey at around 10:00 p.m. and decided to go to İstanbul.

El Delli said they talked about their ordeal with officials from the Lawyers Association for Freedom (ÖHD) and that they expected ÖHD to file criminal charges this week."

The two children were aged five and six.

The five-year-old child reportedly died on Thursday last week (September 2), while his slightly older brother battled for his life following a liver transplant the previous day to try to save his life, ultimately succumbing to the ingested poison on Sunday. The Polish Health Ministry added that the boy had sustained brain damage in addition to the malfunction of his liver.

The family of the two boys had only arrived at a reception camp located about 30 kilometers south of the Polish capital Warsaw on August 23. According to media reports, the Polish government had flown the family of twelve out of Kabul at the request of the United Kingdom, as the father had supposedly worked for the British army in Afghanistan for several years.

The Polish government brought a total of 1,231 people from the Afghan capital to Warsaw with its rescue flights.

Mushroom poisoning

Just one day after arriving at the reception camp, the family reportedly went to pick mushrooms in the camp's wooded area and made a soup using green button mushrooms, which are easy to confuse with edible mushrooms.

Several of the family members complained of having stomach cramps after ingesting the soup. Only the two boys and a 17-year-old girl ultimately needed to be hospitalized. The girl was later released after recovering from severe food poisoning.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Polish Immigration Office rejected media reports saying that the refugees at the reception center had only made the soup after not been given enough to eat. The spokesman said that the day after their arrival, the Afghans were given a two-course lunch, adding that he daily food rations at the shelter consisted of three meals. He announced that following this ""unfortunate event,"" employees at refugee and migrant shelters would be advised that to tell migrants that they should not eat ""products of unknown origin.""

The public prosecutor's office has started to question employees of the reception center about the circumstances of the accident and has launched an inquiry.

The BPA, working alone, handcuffed all four migrants to each other using three pairs of handcuffs. As the BPA assisted the migrants through a barbed wire fence en route to a Border Patrol vehicle, a female migrant slipped her hand from the handcuff and ran towards the Rio Grande River. The woman ran approximately 50 feet and subsequently fell from a 20-foot cliff in the darkness. Upon landing, the woman’s head struck a log near the river’s edge. The BPA requested emergency medical services (EMS) and secured the other three migrants in his vehicle.

Medical personnel from the Laredo Fire Department arrived at the scene. A short time later, medical personnel declared the woman deceased and USBP identified her as a citizen of Mexico.

BPAs arrived in the area and observed numerous suspected undocumented migrants running north across Highway 83. A BPA began looking for undocumented migrants on the south side of Highway 83 and discovered an unresponsive man in medical distress. The BPA immediately requested emergency medical services (EMS).

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — American forces working under heightened security and threats of another attack pressed ahead in the closing days of the U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan after a devastating suicide bombing, and U.S. officials said they had killed a member of the extremist group that the United States believes responsible for it.

A U.S. drone strike early Saturday in eastern Afghanistan killed a member of the country’s Islamic State affiliate, U.S. Central Command said. President Joe Biden has laid responsibility for Thursday’s suicide bombing on that offshoot extremist group which is an enemy both to the West and to Afghanistan’s Taliban and is known for especially lethal attacks.

The death toll in Thursday’s suicide bombing rose to 169 Afghans, a number that could increase as authorities examine fragmented remains, and 13 U.S. service members.

U.S. Central Command said American officials believed the militant killed in Saturday’s drone strike had been involved in planning strikes against the United States in Kabul, and that there were no other known casualties.

The U.S. retaliation comes amid a steady flow of grim warnings from the White House and the Pentagon that there could be more extremist attacks targeting U.S. forces ahead of President Joe Biden’s fast-approaching deadline Tuesday to end the airlift and withdraw American personnel.

The next few days “will be our most dangerous period to date” in the evacuation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, hours before the U.S. issued a security alert for four of the airport gates.

Thursday’s bombing marked one of the most lethal attacks the country has seen. The U.S. said it was the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011.

As the call to prayer echoed Friday through Kabul along with the roar of departing planes, the anxious crowds thronging the airport in hope of escaping Taliban rule appeared as large as ever, despite the scenes of victims lying closely packed together in the aftermath of the bombing.

Around the world, newly arriving Afghan evacuees, many clutching babies and bare handfuls of belongings in plastic bags, stepped off evacuation flights in the United States, in Albania, in Belgium and beyond. In Kabul on Friday, Afghan families looked for loved ones among bodies, placed along a hospital sidewalk for identification, of bombing victims who died pleading for a seat on the U.S.-run airlifts.

Afghans, American citizens and other foreigners were all acutely aware the window was closing to get out via the airlift.

Jamshad went to the airport Friday with his wife and three small children. He clutched an invitation to a Western country he didn’t want to identify.

“After the explosion I decided I would try. Because I am afraid now there will be more attacks, and I think now I have to leave,” said Jamshad, who like many Afghans uses only one name.

The Pentagon said Friday that there was just one suicide bomber — at the airport gate — not two, as U.S. officials initially said. A U.S. official said that the bomber carried a heavier-than-usual load of about 25 pounds of explosives, loaded with shrapnel.

The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss preliminary assessments of the attack. The officials who gave the Afghan death toll also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

The Afghan victims ranged from a hard-working young journalist to an impoverished father, driven to to the airport by hopes of a better life.

The American dead were 11 Marines, a Navy sailor and an Army soldier. Many had been tiny children when U.S. forces first entered Afghanistan in 2001.

One, Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Mae’lee Grant Nikoui, sent a video to a family friend in the United States just hours before he was killed, showing himself smiling and greeting Afghan children.

“Want to take a video together, buddy?” Nikoui asked young boy, leaning in to be in the picture with him. “All right, we’re heroes now, man.”

British officials said two of the country’s citizens and the child of another Briton were among those killed.

On the morning after the attack, the Taliban used a pickup truck full of fighters and three captured Humvees to set up a barrier 500 meters (1,600 feet) from the airport, holding the crowds farther back from the U.S. troops than before.

U.S. military officials said that some gates were closed and other security measures put in place. They said there were tighter restrictions at Taliban checkpoints and fewer people around the gates.

U.S. officials said evacuees with proper credentials still were being allowed through the gates. Inside, about 5,400 evacuees awaited flights.

U.S. commanders had briefed Biden Friday on developing plans to strike back at the Islamic State and make good on the president’s vow to the attackers to “hunt you down and make you pay.”

Biden pronounced the U.S. effort to evacuate Americans, Afghan allies and others most at risk from the Taliban a “worthy mission.”

“And we will complete the mission,” he said.

The Taliban have wrested back control of Afghanistan two decades after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion following the 9/11 attacks. Their return to power has terrified many Afghans, who have rushed to flee the country ahead of the American withdrawal.

More than 100,000 people have been safely evacuated through the Kabul airport, according to the U.S., but thousands more are struggling to leave.

The White House said Friday afternoon that U.S. military aircraft had flown out 2,100 evacuees in the previous 24 hours. Another 2,100 people left on other coalition flights.

The number was a fraction of the 12,700 people carried out by U.S. military aircraft during a brief period when the airlift reached maximum capacity.

France ended its own evacuation effort and pulled up stakes on a temporary French embassy at the airport, leaving Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. U.S. allies and others have ended or are ending their airlifts, in part to give the U.S. time to wrap up its own operations.

The Taliban have said they will allow Afghans to leave via commercial flights after the U.S. withdrawal, but it is unclear which airlines would return to an airport controlled by the militants.

Coast Guard, good Samaritan rescues 1 in Key Biscayne

Editor's Note: Click on image to download high-resolution version.

MIAMI — A Coast Guard Station Miami Beach rescue crew saved one person, Saturday, after a good Samaritan reported a man floating on a makeshift raft in the vicinity of Fowey Rocks.

The owner of the vessel, Spread Out, reported to Sector Miami watchstanders at approximately 1 p.m. that he came across a man on a makeshift raft, and the man stated he left from Cuba, was adrift for 10 days, and the three other people with him had died.

The station rescue crew brought the person to the Coast Guard Cutter Robert Yered. Miami-Dade Fire Boat personnel evaluated the man on the cutter and determined he needed immediate medical care.

Miami-Dade Fire personnel took the man on their vessel and transported him to the hospital.

""We cannot stress enough how dangerous it is to take to the seas and navigate the Florida Straits on unsafe vessels,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Ben Tuxhorn, command center chief, Sector Miami. ""The South Florida maritime community has some of the best people who assist others while on the water, whether that's towing a boat or helping out a migrant with food, water, and bringing them aboard if necessary. Most importantly, this community knows to call the Coast Guard in these situations, because if you don't, you may be part of a human smuggling investigation for just doing the right thing.""

Customs and Border Protection was notified.
